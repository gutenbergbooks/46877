<p class='drop-capa0_0_8 c006'     >It is now nearly thirty years since the late Mr.
Nesbitt wrote the introduction to the catalogue
of the glass at South Kensington. Some years
previously the description of the glass in the Slade
collection had been intrusted to the same gentleman.
Since that time many works treating of special departments
of the history of glass have been published in
France, in Germany, and in Italy. Much fresh light has
been thrown upon the primitive glass of the Egyptians;
our knowledge of the glass of both the Near and the Far
East has been revolutionised; abundant fresh material
has been provided for the history of Byzantine glass, and
the wanderings of the glass-workers from L’Altare and
Murano have been traced in full detail. Mr. Hartshorne,
in his <cite>Old English Glasses</cite>, has exhaustively told the
story of our native glass from the documentary side, and
has described with the minutest detail the wine-glasses of
the eighteenth century. Apart, however, from the introductory
chapters of the last work, I know of no attempt
of recent years to give a general account of the history of
glass—using that term in the narrower sense—as viewed
from the artistic side.</p>

<p class='c001' >We have at hand in the British Museum a collection
of glass that has no rival elsewhere; only second to it is
the collection at South Kensington. It is in these collections
that the history of glass must be studied. I have
from time to time in the following pages called attention
to the most remarkable examples. I hope that what I
have said may assist the student in threading his way
through what is a rather complicated history.</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_vi' id='Page_vi'>vi</a></span>
My best thanks are due to Mr. C. H. Read, who has
charge of the glass in the British Museum, for the facilities
that he has afforded me in the photographing of the
examples in his department; not less to Mr. A. B.
Skinner, director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, for
similar facilities at South Kensington.</p>

<p class='c001' >I am indebted to Professor Church for much valuable
information and for some hitherto unpublished analyses
of glass; to Lord Rothschild and to Mr. Vincent Robinson,
C.I.E., for photographs of examples of glass in their
collections; finally, to Signor Ongania, of Venice, for
permission to reproduce from Passini’s great work on the
Treasury of St. Mark’s some photographs of the glass
there preserved.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_7 c006'     >Glass is a substance in so many ways connected
with the conveniences and amenities of our
daily life, and the word calls up so many varied
associations, that I must here at the very beginning make
clear with what a comparatively small proportion of the
manifold applications of the substance I have to deal.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the first place, this is an art history, so that with
methods of manufacture and practical uses we are only
concerned so far as they may influence or help to explain
points of artistic interest. Again, even on the artistic
side, it is not with every branch of the varied applications
of glass that we shall be occupied in this work. By an
anomaly of the English language, whose vocabulary for
matters connected with the arts is so strangely deficient,
we have come to understand by the term ‘glass,’ when
used without further explanation, what is called in the
trade ‘hollow ware,’ the <em>verrerie</em> of the French; in other
words—vessels of glass. The term may also be extended
to include various minor applications of the material—beads,
small ornaments, etc., what the French call
<em>verroterie</em>. But the application of glass to windows,
especially when coloured and stained glass is in question,
to say nothing of work in mosaic, is usually, although
not always, held to lie outside this narrower connotation
of the word.</p>

<p class='c001' >Now it happens that for us this restriction is in every
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_2' id='Page_2'>2</a></span>
way convenient. For though the material basis is the
same, it is evident that both the artist who works in
mosaic and the designer of stained windows are concerned,
each in his department, with artistic problems only incidentally
connected with the material in which they work.
In other words, the art element in both these crafts only
becomes prominent at a stage when the actual preparation
of the glass is completed. It is, however, certainly
a pity that there is no English word which would not
only clearly connote the class of objects with which I
have here to deal, but which would at the same time
distinctly comprise nothing beyond.</p>

<p class='c001' >I have now explained the somewhat restricted and
artificial sense of the word glass that I propose to accept
in this work. But for a moment let us pass to the other
extreme, and going beyond the ordinary connotation of
the term include in it the glazes of pottery—the word
‘glaze’ is in its origin the same as glass—as well as the
many forms of enamel. In all these cases we are dealing
with substances of similar composition. They may all
probably be traced back to a common origin, so that
from an evolutionary point of view we have here an
instance of the development of the complex and varied
from the simple and single. Looking at the question in
another way, the art of the enameller, using the term in
a restricted sense, may be held to be subsidiary both to
that of the potter and of the glass-worker; while many
of the problems that arise in treating of the glazes of
fictile wares—questions as to fusibility, or as to the
colours employed and the changes of these colours during
the firing—turn up again in the manufacture of glass.
We shall see that experience gained in following the
processes of one art may serve to throw light upon the
difficulties and problems of the other.</p>

<p class='c001' >Historically the connection between glass and pottery
is not so close. In some degree the prevalence of one
art has tended to oust the other, or to relegate it to an
inferior position. The Greeks, who carried the potter’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_3' id='Page_3'>3</a></span>
art to such perfection, knew little about glass—it was
long an exotic substance for them. The Romans, on the
other hand, who in the first centuries of our era first
fully appreciated and developed the capacities of glass,
produced little pottery of artistic interest. In the sixteenth
century, in Umbria and Tuscany, where the finest
majolica was made, we hear nothing of the manufacture
of glass, while on the other hand the fayence of Venice, at
this time pre-occupied with her glass, was of subsidiary
importance. If we turn to the home of porcelain, in China
glass has always held a subordinate position, while in
Japan it was until recent days practically unknown.</p>

<p class='c001' >Were a comparison to be made between the development
of the various minor arts, it would be difficult to
find a wider contrast than that between the history of
porcelain and that of glass. The knowledge of porcelain
was confined for nearly a thousand years to China, the
country where it was first made, and where it was slowly
brought to perfection. Let loose, as it were, in the West
early in the eighteenth century, it had then a short period
of glory, but before the end of the century the art had
already fallen upon evil days. The manufacture of glass,
on the other hand, had long been carried on in Egypt,
and perhaps in other Eastern lands, by a primitive
process, although it only became an article of general
use after the discovery of the blowing-iron. When and
where this discovery was made we do not know—perhaps
somewhere in Syria or Mesopotamia, in the third or
second century before Christ. The art of blowing glass
was known, no doubt, if not fully developed, at the
time when the kingdoms of the Ptolemies and of the
Seleucidæ fell under the rule of the Romans. By them
it was before long brought to perfection and carried into
every corner of the West, so that by the second or third
century of our era the production of glass in Europe
was probably greater than at any subsequent time, at
least until quite recent days. Nor was the art of glass-making
completely extinguished by ‘the advance of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'>4</a></span>
barbarians.’ Indeed, some of the Germanic tribes not
impossibly brought with them a knowledge of the process
not only of preparing but also of blowing glass, picked
up on their journeyings through East Europe, or perhaps
even learned in Western Asia. This was an instance of
the passage to the North and West of the arts of civilisation,
by what we may call the back-road of Europe, in
opposition to the high-roads that led directly from Italy
by way of the Rhone and the Rhine.</p>

<p class='c001' >But in the West the manufacture, though continuously
carried on in many spots, was after the fall of the
Western Empire relegated to the woods,—for nearly a
thousand years little glass was produced of any artistic
interest. Indeed, but few examples of this forest or
green glass of the Middle Ages have survived to our time.
During all this long interval, in one direction only, in the
West, was any advance made. Within this period falls
the great development of stained glass: we must turn
to the glorious windows of the cathedrals of France and
other Western lands, to see what the glass-workers of
the time were capable of producing. In the East, on the
other hand, in the lands ruled from Constantinople or
influenced by Byzantine civilisation, what we know of the
glass of the early Middle Ages is almost confined to the
mosaic coverings of the walls of the contemporary
churches. But just as distinctly as the glass in the
windows of the Gothic churches, this mosaic work, for
the reason we have already given, falls outside our limits.</p>

<p class='c001' >It was not till the end of the twelfth century that any
important advance was made in our narrower department
of ‘hollow ware.’ Among the many beautiful things
made during that glorious season of artistic production
that had its start about this time in Egypt (or perhaps,
rather, in the lands between the Persian Gulf and the
Mediterranean)—except it be the inlaid metal work—there
is nothing that now interests us so much as the
enamelled glass, the beautiful ware that culminated in
the magnificent Cairene mosque lamps of the thirteenth
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>5</a></span>
and fourteenth centuries. The art of enamelling on
glass passed over to Venice in the fifteenth century,
perhaps earlier, and there in the next century the manufacture
of the famous <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> was finally achieved, and
complete mastery was obtained in the working of this
pure white glass. A fresh start was now given to the
industry in the north by means of the Venetian glass-workers,
who were sought for in every country to teach
their new methods.</p>

<p class='c001' >In Germany alone did some of the traditions of the
old forest-workers of ‘green-glass’ survive. By the end
of the seventeenth century the German glass, in some
respects to be regarded as a compromise between the
old and new, had become the most important in Europe.
For a hundred years the products of ‘the mountain fringe
of Bohemia’ held the premier position, but towards the
end of the eighteenth century this place was taken by the
facetted flint-glass of England. It is certainly remarkable
that it is only of quite recent years that any such
prominent position could be claimed for France, which
heretofore had been content to follow in the wake first
of Venice and then of Germany and of England. At
the present day, however, this at least may be said—that
France is almost the only country where any really
artistic work in glass, apart from the reproduction of old
patterns and old methods, is being produced.</p>

<p class='c001' >This hasty sketch of the history of glass-making will
help us to understand why it is that in following the
development of the art in so many lands, and for a period
of more than three thousand years, there is no need to
linger for any time except at a few of the more important
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étapes</span></i>. Indeed such a procedure is forced upon us, for
much of the road is quite barren, other parts are unexplored,
while for whole stages we pass through prosaic
districts where we find little of artistic merit to detain us.</p>

<p class='c001' >The periods, then, of real importance in the history of
glass, either from the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">cultur-historisch</span></i> or from a purely
artistic point of view, are separated by long intervals,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
during which little of interest was produced. The primitive
glass of Egypt, the varied productions of the first
centuries of the Roman Empire, the enamelled glass of
the Saracens, and the Venetian glass of the Renaissance—this
exhausts all that we find either of commanding
historic interest or of superlative artistic merit.
What follows—the German and the Netherlandish glass
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries—is still of
some importance under both these heads. I can hardly
say so much of the English glass of the eighteenth
century; but this glass must not be neglected—it is
English, and it is highly prized by many enthusiastic
collectors.</p>

<p class='c001' >It will be seen that there is a long gap between the
first and second of our critical periods—between the
beginning of the primitive Egyptian and the earliest
Roman glass. This gap will be filled, in some measure,
by some account of the rare surviving specimens of glass
that can claim an Assyrian origin, of the glass pastes of
the Mycenæan age, and of the few examples of glass
that can be strictly classed as Greek of the classical age.
So again of the second long hiatus—the interval of
nearly a thousand years between the period of the
Roman glass and that of the Saracens,—this may be
partly filled by the few scanty pieces that have come
down to us from Sassanian and Byzantine times. To
this period belongs also the glass of the Germanic
tribes of northern Europe, above all that of our Anglo-Saxon
ancestors.</p>

<p class='c001' >Some notice must also be taken of a few districts
situated on bypaths, of the glass from countries that
lie away from the main centres of production—these
latter centres, I may note, until comparatively recent
times are mostly to be found in close connection with
the basin of the Mediterranean. To these outlying
districts we must finally turn to examine the glass of
Persia, of India, and above all the glass of China.</p>

<p class='c001' >An interesting chapter, nay, a separate work, might
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
be devoted to the classification and history of a class of
objects of which the manufacture has been carried on
continuously and with few changes from the time of the
Middle Empire in Egypt—of beads, I mean, and other
allied applications of glass, included in the French term
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i>. But, however great the claims to attention
of such objects, their interest is rather archæological
than artistic, and it will be sufficient to treat of them
incidentally along with the, for us, more important class
of ‘hollow ware’ produced with the aid of the glass-blower’s
tube.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Properties and Composition of Glass</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >Christopher Merret, our earliest English writer on
glass, sets down the properties of the material under
twenty-six heads, ‘by which we may easily differentiate
it from all other bodies.’ From these I will select some
four or five which will be sufficient for our purpose.
Thus, of glass, he says: ‘’Tis a concrete of salt and sand
or stones. ’Tis artificial. It melts in a strong fire.
When melted ’tis tenacious and sticks together....
When melted it cleaves to iron, etc. ’Tis ductile whilst
red-hot, and fashionable into any form, but not malleable,
and it may be blown into a hollowness’ (<cite>Art of Glass</cite>,
1662). Here we have briefly expressed the real <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">differentiæ</span></i>
of glass. It is rather by these properties than by any
virtue of transparency or of definite chemical composition
that glass is to be distinguished from all other bodies;
and it is only by duly taking advantage of these properties
that the preparation of a vessel of glass is
rendered possible.</p>

<p class='c001' >In passing from a liquid to a solid state there intervenes
a viscous stage when the glass may be gathered at
the end of an iron rod; the ductile, tenacious mass may
now be drawn out into long threads, whose length and
fineness are only limited by the difficulty of maintaining
the requisite temperature. Again, if the rod upon which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
the mass is gathered is hollow, the glass may be blown
out into a vesicle or bulb, the starting-point from which
an endless variety of objects, bottles, cups, tubes, or even
flat sheets of glass, may be subsequently formed. Until
advantage was taken of this remarkable property of glass—its
capability, I mean, of being blown out into a hollow
vesicle when in a viscid condition—the art of the glass-maker
was in a primitive stage. We may compare the
glass prepared without the aid of the blowing-tube—that
of the ancient Egyptians, for instance—to the pottery
made by hand before the invention of the potter’s wheel.</p>

<p class='c001' >In dealing with the practical side of our subject—the
materials from which glass is made, how these materials
are first fritted and then fused together, and how the
fused mass is subsequently dealt with—the best plan will
be to approach the questions in each case from the point
of view of the time and country. But as, on the one
hand, for classical times, our sources of information for
these practical details are but scanty, and as, on the other,
I am not concerned with the industrial developments
of the nineteenth century, it will be well to postpone
any fuller treatment of such matters until I come to
speak of the glass of late Mediæval and Renaissance times.
I shall then be able to make use of contemporary accounts
which will throw light on the processes of manufacture.</p>

<p class='c001' >A few preliminary notes on the chemical and physical
properties of glass may, however, not be out of place.</p>

<p class='c001' >Glass, Merret tells us, is ‘a concrete of salt and sand
or stones.’ This, in modern scientific language, we should
express by saying that it is a combination of silica with
an alkali. But these substances alone are not enough.
You cannot make a glass fit for practical use from a pure
quartz sand with the addition of nothing else than a salt
of potash or soda. Such a glass—a simple alkaline
silicate—would indeed be transparent, but it would be
difficult to work and very fragile. In all cases there is
need of a second base, and this, to speak generally, should
be either lime or oxide of lead. The latter base we may
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
for the present neglect; speaking generally, it is the
presence of lime that gives the working qualities and the
requisite toughness. These, then, are the essential
materials for the preparation of glass. Other substances
may be present; alumina, for example, or one or other of
the oxides of iron, but as a rule the presence of these
latter bases is not desired—the glass would be better
without them.</p>

<p class='c001' >Putting aside, then, for the present the glass in which
lead is a constituent, as well as that in which the soda is
replaced by potash, it is remarkable how little difference
of composition we find in examples of glass of the most
divergent origin. Let us compare the composition of a
Roman ‘lachrymatory’ with that of a piece of modern
English plate-glass. In a hundred parts we find—</p>

<p class='c001' >These examples are indeed two extreme terms of a
long but continuous series. A sample of Saracenic glass
of the fourteenth or of Venetian glass of the sixteenth
century, would yield on analysis much the same result.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >This, then, may be regarded as the normal composition
of such glass as I shall have to deal with in this history.
The main question has generally been—How can the
sand or silica, the premier element in glass, be best
converted into a substance which shall in external aspect
resemble as closely as possible the native rock crystal
(itself pure silica), but which at the same time shall be
not only fusible, but after fusing pass on cooling through
a plastic condition when it may be expanded into a
vesicle and otherwise worked up into various shapes?
Long practical experience has shown that this can be best
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
effected by adding to the sand materials containing both
soda and lime, and as far as possible nothing beyond these
bases. A glass thus compounded we may take as our
normal type, but, as I have said, the soda may in certain
cases be replaced by potash and the lime by lead oxide.</p>

<p class='c001' >Silica in any case is the essential element in glass,
and in any normal glass there may be present from 60 to
75 per cent. If, however, the bases with which it is
combined have a high combining number—and this is
especially the case with lead—the percentage of silica
may fall below the former figure. Thus, in a bottle
glass with 12 per cent. of iron oxide and alumina<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c018'><sup>[2]</sup></a> the
proportion is reduced to 54 per cent., and in a flint glass
with 43 per cent. of lead oxide there is only 45 per cent.
of silica.</p>

<p class='c001' >It was once the fashion among English writers on glass
to classify the substance under the heads of crown-glass,
bottle-glass, broad-glass, plate-glass, flint-glass, etc.; but
such a classification, not very logical in itself, would be
of no use to us.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c018'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Glass, of course, varies in optical properties, in hardness,
and in fusibility, but I do not think that any
useful classification could be based directly on these
properties. But there is one distinction of the greatest
importance technically and geographically, and this is
between the glass of maritime countries in which the
alkali is soda, and that of inland and forest districts
where the soda is replaced by potash. In the first group,
by far the most important—I have indeed regarded such
glass as the normal type—may, it would seem, be placed
not only the ‘primitive’ glass of the Eastern Mediterranean,
but probably all the glass of the Romans. To it
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
belongs also the glass of the Saracens and the greater
part of the artistic glass of the Renaissance, including the
Venetian glass, although in this last the soda is often
in part replaced by an appreciable quantity of potash.
The potash group, on the other hand, includes the old
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voirre à fougère</span></i> of the French and the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">wald-glas</span></i> of the
Germans. In addition, almost the whole of the glass
of higher quality made in later days in Germany and in
the Bohemian borderlands belongs essentially to this
last class. Finally, it may be mentioned that in the
case of the abnormal family where the lime is replaced
by oxide of lead, the alkali is invariably potash. Of this
family our English flint-glass is the most important
member.</p>

<p class='c001' >With regard to the hardness of glass, Merret mentions
as the thirteenth property possessed by that substance,
‘that it only receives sculpture or cutting from a
<i>Diamond</i> or <i>Emery</i> stone.’ But such a statement
would be likely to give an exaggerated idea of the hardness
of glass. If we take the scale of hardness used by
the mineralogist, it will be found that there are few kinds
of glass that do not fall between the fifth and sixth
divisions of that scale. In other words, it would be difficult
to find a specimen of glass on which a crystal of
apatite (phosphate of lime) would make any impression,
whereas all glass in ordinary use is readily scratched by
felspar. It is possible, however, that some kinds of
Bohemian glass may equal the latter mineral in hardness;
it is indeed a common statement that certain Bohemian
or German ‘combustion-tubes’ will strike fire with steel.
On the other hand, the presence of lead tends to make a
soft glass; our cut flint is perceptibly softer than common
window-glass, and perhaps the most important defect of
the paste used to imitate precious stones—such paste
may contain as much as 50 per cent. of lead oxide—is to
be found in its comparative softness.</p>

<p class='c001' >At the same time, the greater the amount of lead in a
glass, the greater its dispersive power on the light that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
passes through it. Hence the brilliancy and fire of flint-glass,
and still more of artificial gems.</p>

<p class='c001' >Apart from the varieties containing lead, samples of
glass differ little in weight; the specific gravity may
range between 2·4 and 2·8. That of flint-glass, on the
other hand, varies from 3 to 3·8; indeed in some optical
glasses containing a large percentage of lead, and again
in the paste used for false jewellery, the specific gravity
may be as high as 4·5 or even 5.</p>

<p class='c001' >The high melting-point, or more definitely the high
softening-point, of certain kinds of Bohemian and German
glass, makes them invaluable in the laboratory of the
chemist. On the other hand, the ready fusibility of glass
containing lead was, as we shall see, one of the causes
that promoted the adoption of such a glass in our furnaces.</p>

<p class='c001' >Thus we find that the potash-lime glass of Bohemia,
containing a high percentage of silica, excels in hardness
and resistance to heat; on the other hand, the various
kinds of glass containing lead are soft and easily fusible,
and at the same time they combine a high specific gravity
with a wide dispersive power. What we may call the
maritime or soda-lime glass takes an intermediate place
in all these respects. This is indeed an additional reason
for regarding this great family of ‘Mediterranean’ glass
as the normal type.</p>

<p class='c001' >The two essential elements, then, required by the glass-maker
are, in the first place, silica, and secondly an alkali,
in each case as pure as possible, and in a convenient form
for mixing and fusing together. I do not propose here
to do more than indicate the source of these materials.</p>

<p class='c001' >The silica has at all times been derived either from
solid quartz, whether in the form of rock crystal or of the
white pebbles from the beds of Alpine rivers, or more
often from sand obtained either by excavation or from
the seashore.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the case of the alkali, the maritime people of the
South extracted their soda, for the most part, from the
ashes of certain plants growing in salt marshes near the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
sea. Most of these maritime plants belong to the natural
order of the Chenopodiaceæ, the goose-foot or spinach
tribe, and we find among them various species of Salsola,
Chenopodium, Salicornia, etc. These plants were all
included in old days under the vague name of <i>kali</i>.
The roughly lixiviated ashes exported from Spain were
known in the trade as <i>barilla</i>; those from the Levant
as <i>roquetta</i>.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c018'><sup>[4]</sup></a> In other instances the impure alkaline
carbonates were found ready at hand—as in the case of
the natron deposits not far from Cairo. In the North the
principal source of soda was till recent days the <i>varech</i> or
kelp, cast up on the west coast of France and of Scotland.</p>

<p class='c001' >The inland folk, on the other hand, had to find the
alkali for their glass in the ashes of plants. This ‘potash’
was obtained by lixiviating the ashes of various
trees and bushes—in Germany the ashes of beechwood,
in France those of the bracken or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fougère</span></i>, were most in
favour.</p>

<p class='c001' >The quality of the glass depended in great measure
upon the care taken in the preparation of the soda or
potash. But the more impure ashes had this advantage:
the amount of lime, to say nothing of the iron oxide and
alumina, that they contained, rendered unnecessary in
many cases the addition of any further basic material;
even the comparatively pure Spanish barilla contained as
much as seven per cent. of lime. In other cases that base
had to be added, generally in the form of a more or less
impure limestone.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of the furnaces and of the various operations that
come into play in the preparation of the glass I shall
treat as the occasion arises in the following chapters.
As, however, in this book we are—at least after the
‘primitive glass’ has been dealt with in the next chapter—almost
exclusively concerned with vessels of ‘hollow
ware’ made by a blowing process, it may be well to indicate,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
in this introductory chapter, the nature of this
process, and to give the names of the principal tools used.
These implements—apart from quite modern improvements
with which I am not concerned here—are of the
simplest nature, and have undergone little change during
the last five hundred years—perhaps I might say since
the days of the Romans.</p>

<p class='c001' >The molten glass is collected on the extremity of the
blowing-iron to form a ‘gathering.’ This gathering,
while still in a soft condition, is rolled upon the ‘marver’
into a cylindrical mass. By blowing down the tube this
mass is now distended to form a hollow pear-shaped
vesicle, for which it will be convenient to adopt the
French term <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paraison</span></i>. It is from this paraison that a
start is made to form by a ‘spinning’ or ‘flashing’ process
a sheet of broad or crown glass; again, the vesicle
may be made to assume a cylindrical shape, and then
opened out to form larger sheets of glass; or finally—and
this is for us the most important—by holding the
blowing-iron to which the bulb of glass is attached in a
vertical position (or sometimes by swinging it over the
workman’s head), and then by shaping it by means of
certain simple tools, the paraison is started on the course
by which it will finally be converted into a bottle or into
a bowl-shaped vessel. I will here only dwell on one
point. It is evident that so long as the glass is attached
to the blowing-iron, although a simple bulb-shaped vessel
may be formed, there is so far no means of shaping or
finishing the upper portion. Before this can be done the
further extremity of the paraison must be attached by
means of a small gathering of molten glass to a light
tapering rod of iron, the ‘punto’ or ‘pontil.’ The vessel—for
so the paraison may now be called—is at this stage
removed from the blowing-iron. This is done by ‘wetting
it off’ by means of a rod of moistened iron. The
glass vessel, now attached by its base to the pontil, is
reheated, and the further treatment taken in hand by a
workman seated on a stool with long projecting arms,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
on which (or on the knee of the workman) the pontil is
rotated. The shaping is chiefly done by an iron instrument
called the ‘procello,’ or spring-tool, formed like a
pair of sugar-tongs by two blades connected by an elastic
bow. Finally, the edges are finished off by shears and
scissors of various forms, which cut the hot glass as if it
were a piece of soft leather. The now finished vessel is
removed from the pontil by wetting the point of attachment,
and is taken to the annealing oven.</p>

<p class='c001' >In this very summary account of the processes involved
in making, say, a flask of simple shape, I have
only dwelt upon such instruments and methods as have
for several centuries been in general use.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Decay of Glass</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >Before ending this preliminary chapter, a few words
may be said of the changes that take place in glass in
the course of time from the action of the surrounding
medium.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c018'><sup>[5]</sup></a> These changes are in the main due to the
moisture and carbonic acid contained either in the soil
or in the atmosphere. Perhaps what is most striking in
this action is on the one hand the apparently capricious
and irregular way in which the glass is attacked, and on
the other the great beauty of the iridescent effects that so
often accompany the process of decay.</p>

<p class='c001' >As to the apparent irregularity in the progress of the
superficial decay, it would seem that, apart from differences
in the chemical composition of the glass, much
depends upon the preservation of the original smooth
‘epidermis.’ Once this is impaired, whether by accidental
scratches or by the growth of fungus or lichen,
the carbonic acid or the ammonia salts contained in the
air or soil find, in the presence of moisture, a secure
lodgment, and the work of decay proceeds rapidly. Thus
in the case of the little flasks of primitive glass of which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
I shall have to speak in the next chapter, in one example
it may be found that the smooth skin of the glass has for
more than three thousand years remained absolutely intact,
while in another specimen from a neighbouring tomb
the glass not only on the surface, but far into the interior,
has taken on a talc-like or porcelainous consistency, and
the brilliant colours have for the most part disappeared.</p>

<p class='c001' >There is no need to enter into the details of the
chemical processes involved in this process of decay.
Suffice to say that the action is one of the same nature
as that which has played so important a part in the
geological changes of the earth’s surface, especially in the
disintegration of the granitic rocks. It depends upon the
power possessed by carbonic acid, in the presence of
moisture, of decomposing the silicates of the alkalis. The
soluble carbonate of soda or of potash thus formed is
then quickly washed out from the surface of the glass.
There remains, in the form either of iridescent scales or
of an opaque pearly crust, a layer consisting not perhaps
of pure silica, but of an acid silicate of lime, alumina, or
lead as the case may be.</p>

<p class='c001' >Now a piece of clear glass may appear to the eye to
be devoid of internal structure. But the ‘metal’ has, we
know, in every case been subjected during the manufacture
to a complicated series of involutions and doublings,
to say nothing of the subsequent inflation if the
glass has been subjected to a blowing process. When
decay sets in—something similar may at times be
seen in the case of a piece of wrought iron—this complicated
formation is in part revealed, for it is evident
that upon it the lines taken by the decay are in a measure
dependent. On blown glass especially, the disintegration
of the surface tends to result in a scaly formation
resembling that of the shell of an oyster. As a result
of the decomposition of light in its passage through
these fine superficial films, and of the partial reflection
from the back of the scales at various depths, we get
those unsurpassed iridescent effects that we associate
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
above all with the glass of the Romans. That these
brilliant hues are dependent entirely upon the physical
structure is well shown by the total disappearance of
the colours when the surface of a piece of iridescent
glass is moistened, as well as by their reappearance when
the glass is again dried.</p>

<p class='c001' >Lead of glass is much less liable to such changes, but
where in such glass decay has once set in, the whole mass
may be converted into a white horny substance.</p>

<p class='c001' >In other cases the surface of a piece of clear white
glass will become gradually filled with a series of minute
intersecting fissures, which in time may penetrate the
whole mass. When this change has been fully developed
we get a true crackle-glass, not to be confounded with
the frosted glass of Venice mentioned in <a href='#ch13'>Chapter XIII</a>.
This fissuring of the glass-mass in its various stages may
be traced in many of the specimens of Venetian, Netherlandish,
and English glass at South Kensington. When
fully developed the effect is at times very beautiful.</p>

<p class='c001' >The tints of coloured glass may, it would seem,
change in the course of time. Colourless glass also,
from which the greenish shades derived from protoxide
of iron have been removed by the addition of binoxide of
manganese, is above all liable to assume in the course of
time a purple tint under the action of sunlight. Again,
if sulphur be present in glass, as is the case where sulphate
of soda has been employed as a source of the
alkali, the soda salt may be reduced by any protoxide of
iron that is present. The sulphide of sodium and the
sesqui-oxide of iron thus gradually formed will both of
them tend to give a yellowish tint to the glass.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c018'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Changes of this nature may occasionally have come
about in the stained glass of the windows of our Gothic
churches—the flesh-tints, which we know were produced
in early days by manganese, may in the course of time
have become of a more pronounced purple hue.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />THE PRIMITIVE GLASS OF THE EGYPTIANS AND SYRIANS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c019' >From a technical point of view the history of glass
might be divided into three periods—periods, it
is true, of very unequal length and relative importance.</p>

<p class='c001' >The first of these, one more especially of archæological
interest, would include all the glass made before
the discovery of the process of forming a vesicle by
blowing through a hollow tube. Nearly all the glass
that finds its way into our collections would be classed
in the second period; this would extend from the
beginning of our era to the end of the eighteenth
century. In the course of these long centuries, the work
of the glass-maker has of course been influenced by the
varying schools and fashions of different ages and
countries, but technically there is no great advance to be
noted in the work of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries when compared with that of the early days of
the Roman Empire; and this is still more true if we
consider merely the materials employed, their preparation,
and the methods of their fusion. But before the
end of the eighteenth century a great change had set in.
The manufacture of glass in England and France had
become an important industry, and we enter upon the
third or industrial period. With the general advance in
mechanical processes that is so characteristic of the time,
the old methods of the working of glass were swept
aside, so that before the middle of the last century, whatever
of interest was to be found in the manufacture and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
in its results depended upon anything rather than upon
the artistic qualities of the glass made.</p>

<p class='c001' >Now, as I have said, the characteristic and dominant
quality of glass is to be found in its capability of being
blown into vessels of varying shape when in a viscous
and semi-fluid state. All glass then, made at a time
when advantage had not yet been taken of that essential
property of the material, we may class together in a
primitive group. This line of demarcation is as important,
to return to a comparison I have already made,
as that between hand-moulded pottery and that thrown
on the potter’s wheel. The objects made in the earlier
period by primitive processes were mostly small, and
their merit depended chiefly upon the brilliancy and the
skilful juxtaposition of a few simple colours—they may
for the most part be classed as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c001' >It has long been acknowledged that it is from Egypt
that our earliest specimens of glass have come. But
until quite recently the greatest misconceptions have
prevailed as to the age and the methods of preparation of
Egyptian glass. Misled by an erroneous interpretation
of what are probably representations of metallurgical processes,
on the walls of Twelfth Dynasty tombs at Beni
Hassan and elsewhere, it was inferred that the art of
blowing glass was known to the Egyptians at least as
long ago as the days of the Middle Empire; by others
the art was carried back to a still earlier period. We now
have almost full assurance that glass in a true sense was
practically unknown to the Egyptians before the time of
the Eighteenth Dynasty (say between 1600 and 1500 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>),<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c018'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
and that for at least a thousand years after that period
all that was made was produced by a primitive process in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
which the blowing-iron found no part. We have, unfortunately,
up to the present time absolutely no evidence
to show in what country or at what date this new process—I
mean the blowing of a vesicle of glass—first came
into use. There is, as we shall see, some reason to look
for it rather in Western Asia than in Egypt, but the
important point to bear in mind is that it was only after
the introduction of this process of blowing, first to
Alexandria and then to the Rome of the early empire,
that the employment of glass for objects of daily use
became in any way general.</p>

<p class='c001' >Glass, indeed, in these early days, whether in Egypt
or in the Greek world of the Mycenæan age, was something
very different from what we now understand by
the term. We must ‘think away’ a great deal of the
modern connotation of the word. We must, above all,
think of the material in connection with the native
precious or semi-precious stones that it more or less
resembled, and which were used along with it for decorative
purposes. We do not know the Egyptian name for
glass, but probably, like the Greeks, they divided all the
hard stony bodies used in the arts into such as were ‘dug
up’—natural products, that is, which they found ready at
hand—and such as had been artificially prepared, and
above all previously melted (the
Λίθος όρωρυγμένη
on the
one hand, and the
Λίθος χυτή
on the other).</p>

<p class='c001' >If, as I have said, there is little evidence for the
existence of glass in Egypt before the Eighteenth
Dynasty, it is quite otherwise with regard to a very
similar substance, identical almost in chemical composition—one
whose history can be traced much further back.
On beads of clear rock crystal, dating from the First
Dynasty, and it would seem from an even earlier period
in some cases, we find a coating of turquoise blue transparent
glaze<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c018'><sup>[8]</sup></a>—the very glaze, in fact, that has given a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
prevailing tint to the vast series of smaller objects of
Egyptian art that we see in the cases of our museums.
A similar colour, I may observe, continued in favour in
Mohammedan times, and indeed gives a dominant note
to Oriental art in contrast to the ochry tints of yellow,
red, and brown prevalent in the West.</p>

<p class='c001' >The Egyptians soon learned to apply this blue glaze—essentially
a silicate of soda and copper—to the surface
of other natural stones, and above all to a fritty porous
earthenware, the so-called Egyptian porcelain. Such an
alkaline glaze, indeed, will only adhere to a porous base
of this kind, with which it becomes united on firing, by a
chemical reaction, or at least by the solution in it of some
of the silicates of alumina and lime in the clay. This
glaze differs essentially from those used on true porcelain—these
last are almost of the same composition as the
ground they cover—but, as in the case of the glazes on
porcelain, so the materials of the Egyptian glazes were
probably first incorporated together in a partially fused
frit which was then ground and mixed with water to form
a soup-like ‘slip,’ into which the object to be glazed was
dipped. There have been brought from Egypt a few rare
objects carved out of a blue frit (probably similar to that
used in the preparation of glazes), for which a very early
date has been claimed. But such a frit is no true glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >The Egyptians had from the earliest periods been
adepts in the carving of native minerals and rocks, and
evidently found great pleasure in the strange markings
and contrasts of colour found on their polished surfaces.
Already in pre-dynastic times they availed themselves
of their native granites, porphyries and conglomerates;
from these materials they manufactured those large, carefully
turned vases of which so many have lately been
brought from Egypt. For smaller objects—jewellery,
beads, and inlay of various descriptions—they had command
of a wide scale of colours—reds and tawny yellows
from jasper, purple from the amethyst, greens from root
of emerald and from a special kind of felspar, and blue
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
from the turquoise and (at a very early period) from the
<i>lapis lazuli</i>. But the stones to which they had recourse
for their favourite blues and greens were rare, and they
were therefore the more ready to find a cheaper substitute
in glass. Again, in Egypt, no stone was in
greater favour than the native alabaster,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c018'><sup>[9]</sup></a> with its
bands and zig-zag lines of transparent crystals in an
opaque base of a warm milky hue. But there was no
play of colour in this latter substance, and its very softness
restricted the uses to which it could be put. In
glass they found a substance hard enough to allow of
more delicate forms, and on it chevrons of yellow and
white could be traced upon a nearly opaque ground of
turquoise or dark blue. Some such origin in native
stones we may perhaps find for the decorative motives
of the little vases, variously known as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">phialæ</span></i>, <i>unguentaria</i>,
<i>alabastra</i>, which were in such favour not only
with the Egyptians, but perhaps even more so among
the inhabitants of the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean,
during a period of at least a thousand years. It
is indeed these little vases that are the most characteristic
product of the first period of glass-making.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is not too much to say that the little we know of the
processes of these early Egyptian glass-makers is derived
from notices on the subject scattered through the memoirs
in which Dr. Flinders Petrie has described the results of
his excavations, more especially from the report issued in
1894, on his discoveries at Tell-el-Amarna. In the introduction
to the catalogue of the Egyptian Exhibition held
at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1895, Dr. Petrie has
summed up our knowledge on this subject. I will quote
the description of the method by which, according to
him, these alabastra were made.</p>

<p class='c001' >‘A metal rod of the size of the intended interior of the
neck, and rather conical, was coated at the end with a ball
of sand held together by cloth and string. This was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
covered with glass, probably by winding a thread of glass
round it, as large beads of this age are thus made.
The vase could then be reheated as often as needed for
working by holding it in a furnace, the metal rod forming
a handle, and the sand inside the vase preventing its
collapse. Threads of coloured glass could then be wound
round it and incorporated by rolling; the wavy pattern
was produced by dragging the surface in different directions,
the foot was pressed into shape by pincers, the
brim was formed, and the handles were put on. Lastly,
on cooling, the metal rod would contract and come loose
from the neck, and after it was withdrawn the sand could
be rubbed out from the body of the vase.’</p>

<p class='c001' >The wavy decoration thus obtained was of two types:
(i) formed simply by a succession of crescent-shape
curves, or (ii) by means of a double drag, the pattern
assumed a form like a frond of palm leaves, or still more
like these leaves plaited into a basket. (Cf. <a href='#p02'>Pl. <span class='fss'>II.</span></a>)</p>

<p class='c001' >The number of these little vases that can be definitely
attributed to the Eighteenth Dynasty (say about the sixteenth
or fifteenth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) is small, but it is worthy
of note that for brilliancy of colour and for purity of the
glassy paste, the early examples are unsurpassed in later
times. This is certainly a remarkable fact, especially if we
are to regard the art as a new one. I cannot enter here
into the evidence that would seem to point to a foreign
origin for this early Egyptian glass—it will be enough
to mention the conquests of Thothmes <span class='fss'>III.</span> in Syria,
and the close relation of his successor, Akhenaten, the
‘heretic king,’ with Syria and Babylonia, as shown by
his marriage, and by the famous Tell-el-Amarna tablets.
As bearing on this question I may refer to certain
paintings on a tomb of this age at Drag Aboul Neggah,
near Thebes (reproduced in the <cite>Revue Archéologique</cite>,
1895, Pl. 15), which represent the unloading of a foreign
trading-vessel. We can distinguish here the merchants
offering certain objects of value to an Egyptian official;
among these are certain striped vases which have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
doubtfully recognised as of glass. In the hieroglyphics
accompanying wall paintings of this period we more than
once find that vessels of rock crystal and <i>lapis lazuli</i> are
mentioned, as well as blocks of uncut stones, and neither
by the hieroglyphics used nor by the representation of the
objects would it be easy to distinguish the latter material
from lumps of glass. Again, Syrian workmen are known
to have been employed at this time in Egypt, and nowhere
would this be more likely than in the immediate neighbourhood
of the palace of the king at Tell-el-Amarna,
where the glass-works described by Dr. Petrie were
situated.</p>

<p class='c001' >All this, however, is mere conjecture, while as an
argument for the native origin of Egyptian glass we
have the indisputable fact that the manufacture was
carried on in the new town established by Akhenaten at
Tell-el-Amarna (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</span></i> 1450-1400 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>). This is made
clear by the discoveries of Dr. Petrie in the winter of
1891-92. Among the waste-heaps of some important
glass factories he has found enough material to put it
beyond doubt that glass was there prepared from its
raw constituents. First, with regard to the frits, the
essential preliminary stage in the manufacture of glass:
as I have said, some such half-fused material must have
been long in use by the Egyptians in the preparation
of their blue glazes. Complete freedom from iron was
attained in this case (just as in after days by the Venetians)
by the employment of crushed pebbles of white
quartz as the source of the silica. These pebbles served
also for the floor of the furnace, and they were doubtless
more easily crushed after being thus used for some time.
The fritting-pans, to judge from some large fragments of
frit that turned up, were shallow bowls some ten inches
across. These pans were, it would seem, supported for
firing by cylindrical jars resembling the seggars of porcelain
works. The shape and size of the crucibles in which
the frit was subsequently melted may be inferred from
some masses of glass found in the rubbish. These
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
masses had been allowed to cool in the melting-pot, and
the presence of frothy and worthless matter at the top
was a proof that the glass was not merely remelted in
them, but prepared on the spot from the above-mentioned
frit. The glass was left to solidify in the crucible, and
when cold, the crucible, as well as the scum at the top,
was chipped away, leaving a clear lump of good glass.
Dr. Petrie thinks that this glass was not remelted as a
whole for subsequent working, but that lumps of suitable
size were chipped off, and these, being heated to softness,
‘were then laid on a flat surface and rolled by a bar
worked diagonally across them; ... the marks of this
diagonal rolling are seen on the finished rolls.’ The rods
thus produced were now drawn out to form a cane, or, if
previously rolled flat, a thin ribbon. Beads were formed
by winding these canes or threads of glass round a wire,
or rather round a fine rod of hammered bronze, for wire-drawing
was an invention of a much later date; such
rods have indeed been found with the unfinished beads
still on them. Similar canes of glass were doubtless
worked in to the sides of the little vases to form the
banded and chevron decoration which I have already
described.</p>

<p class='c001' >The silica for this glass was derived, as we have seen,
from quartz pebbles, but we have no information as to
the source of the other important constituent, the alkali.
It is known, however, that the glass of the ancients was
essentially a soda-glass, made for the most part in maritime
regions. Again, the possibility of obtaining an
abundant supply of fuel has always been an important
element in the selection of localities for glass-works.
Now in the neighbourhood of Thebes fuel must always
have been scarce and dear, and it is uncertain whether
there was any source of soda near at hand. We may
perhaps regard the glass-works of Tell-el-Amarna as due
in the main to the caprice of that eccentric sovereign
Akhenaten. They were probably started at his orders to
supply the demand for the new material then coming
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
into favour at his court. In so far as the making of glass
ever became an industry in Egypt, we must look rather
to the neighbourhood of the Delta for its development.
There at least fuel would be more abundant, and there
a supply of soda was at hand in the ashes of marine
plants, even if the natron of the adjacent salt lakes was
not yet used for the purpose.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c018'><sup>[10]</sup></a> But until a much later
date, glass was always a somewhat rare substance in
Egypt, and was, it would seem, never produced on a
large scale.</p>

<p class='c001' >I must now say something as to the source of the
colours with which the Egyptians stained their glass. In
the absence of any satisfactory analyses, we are strangely
in the dark on this interesting question.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c018'><sup>[11]</sup></a> But everything
points to the predominance of copper as a colouring
material at an early period, so much so that we may
perhaps consider—and this is a suggestion that has
indeed been already made by a French writer—that the
invention of glazes in the first place, and then that of
glass, were offshoots of the metallurgy of copper, and that
these industries may therefore be especially connected
with the copper age. In any case, it was in all probability
not, as in later days, a more or less transparent and
colourless glass, but rather one of a pale or dark blue
colour, that at the commencement formed the basis to
which a decoration of other colours was added.</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
The famous blue of the Egyptians, of which we hear
from Vitruvius and other later writers, was essentially a
silicate of soda, lime, and copper. It should be borne in
mind that without the presence of the first two bases—the
lime and the soda—a good copper blue in glass or
glaze cannot be obtained. Indeed in the case of porcelain
and fayence, the blues obtained from copper have always
been confined to various shades of turquoise, as in the
well-known glazes and enamels of the Chinese and the
French, and even these turquoise blues, always, as we
have said, containing lime and soda as well as copper,
have only been produced with great difficulty. The
mastery of a complete series of copper blues, ranging
through every shade from a blue-black to a pale greenish
turquoise, we may thus regard as a special triumph of the
old Egyptians. At one period a darker shade has been in
favour, at another a paler hue, according as the <i>lapis lazuli</i>
on the one hand, or the turquoise or green felspar on the
other, was taken as the standard of excellence, so that the
shade of colour of the glaze on a scarab or a bead may at
times throw some light on its date.</p>

<p class='c001' >Distinct shades of green, apart from greenish blue,
were much less in favour with the Egyptians, nor did
they ever attain to the brilliant tints of the malachite.
A green glass, generally comparatively transparent, was
indeed at times obtained when a certain amount of iron
was present in the materials employed; but this was
merely an accidental modification of the blue. The pale
tint of the green felspar was also imitated in an opaque
glass used for inlaying.</p>

<p class='c001' >For their reds the Egyptians were content to imitate
the colour of the jasper, and here again they had recourse
to copper; the transparent ruby tints of the mediæval
workmen, whether obtained from copper or gold, were
unknown to them. Their opaque red glass owed its
colour to the presence, in large quantities, of the basic
oxide of copper. In later specimens as much as 15 or
even 20 per cent. has been found; some tin seems to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
always present, giving an opaque enamel-like appearance
to the Egyptian red—perhaps the colour was prepared
directly from bronze. We often find this red paste
oxidised on the surface; the coating of green carbonate
then gives it the appearance of a richly patinated bronze,
the blood-red body only showing when the specimen
has been chipped. It is an interesting point that in early
times the use of this red glass appears to have been confined
to inlaid work—that is to say, it was never worked
up with glass of other colours. This was, no doubt,
for a practical reason: during the elaborate processes
of patting, shaping, and reheating involved in the old
system of working, the materials must have been exposed
to a strong oxidising influence, and the basic red glass
would thereby have lost its fine colour; it would also, perhaps,
have injuriously affected the neighbouring colours.
Some such difficulties in the working together of glasses
of various colours may have influenced the Egyptians in
adhering to their old system of inlays, employing, that is,
small pieces, separately cast or cut out in the cold from
slabs of glass of various colours. In such inlays the red
paste was freely used from early times. On the other
hand, I do not think that this fine copper red has ever
been found on a glass vase of Egyptian <i>provenance</i>. On
a few rare examples of later date (note especially two
alabastra in the Slade collection, Nos. 15 and 35) we find
indeed an opaque red combined with other colours, and
in one case it forms the base (<a href='#p02'>Plate <span class='fss'>II.</span></a>). This red paste
is of a peculiar spotty consistence, and I am inclined
to think that the colouring matter in these examples is
rather iron than copper. In later days the Egyptians
made use of another tint, a fine orange. This colour, indeed,
would seem to be the only addition to their palette
during a period of more than fifteen hundred years.</p>

<p class='c001' >The purple tint derived from oxide of manganese was
known from very early times; the colour has been found
in the glazes of the First Dynasty. It was, however, rarely
used by the Egyptians for colouring glass. In some of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
the little vases from the Greek islands and elsewhere it
has, however, been employed to form a zigzag of the
usual type upon an opaque white ground. If we so rarely
find this amethyst purple combined with other colours,
this is probably for a reason of a similar nature to that
dwelt upon in the case of the copper red.</p>

<p class='c001' >Next to the two shades of blue, the colour most
frequently found on Egyptian glass is a yellow, at times
of a full mustard tint, but more often of a paler hue.
Feather-like curved chevrons of this colour, combined with
turquoise and opaque white on a deep blue ground, constitute
indeed the normal type of decoration in a whole series
of these little vases. I can find no record of any analysis
of this yellow colour, but we may well compare it with
the fine yellow glazes of the Chinese where the colour is
derived from a mixture of an ochry earth with an oxide of
antimony. There is no doubt that this last metal was
known to the Egyptians; it was used at an early period
by the women to darken the outline of their eyes.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c018'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >What has been said of the colours used by the
Egyptians applies equally to the whole series of this
primitive glass, indeed to a large extent to the glass of
the Romans as well. It will form, I hope, a solid introduction
to the subject generally.</p>

<p class='c001' >The little vases or <i>unguentaria</i>—by far the most
important objects in this division of our subject—occur
in Egypt in two forms. First, the true columnar kohl-pots,
spreading out at the top in the form of a lotus
capital. Secondly, globular jars with a pair of small
handles: these jars are sometimes flattened at the sides
so as to pass into the shape of a pilgrim’s flask. In a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
little vase of this latter form in the British Museum the
paste is of a deep, somewhat translucent, brownish red
(<a href='#p02'>Plate <span class='fss'>II.</span></a>), and this colour passes in other examples into
a rich transparent honey-red or hyacinth tint. The
colour in both cases is, I think, derived from iron.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of quite exceptional interest is the little vase in the
British Museum, bearing the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prænomen</span></i> of Thothmes <span class='fss'>III.</span>,
painted in yellowish enamel round the shoulder. I say
painted, for in this case the decoration is simply applied
to the surface, and not incorporated into the glass, thus
forestalling the later processes of enamelling upon glass.
The vase in question is somewhat rudely formed; it is of
an opaque paste of a remarkably fine turquoise hue, and
the sides are decorated with three conventional trees also
in yellow enamel. This vase has been regarded as the
earliest dated specimen of true glass that is so far known
to us.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c018'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >The British Museum has lately acquired a curious
vessel of glass, five inches in height, somewhat of the
shape of a Greek <i>crater</i>. The wavy, dragged decoration
on a pale slaty ground calls to mind certain early vases
of wood or stone <em>painted</em> with a similar design. This
vase, together with a cup of azure blue transparent paste,
comes probably from the tomb of Amenophis <span class='fss'>II.</span> Another
little vase in the same collection, of <i>aryballos</i> outline, has
been shaped apparently by the lathe—so accurate is the
form—from a mass of opaque turquoise paste of frit-like
nature.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c018'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >It was in the tombs of Amenophis <span class='fss'>II.</span> and <span class='fss'>III.</span>, in the
Valley of the Kings, near Thebes, that the unique series
of glass vases, now in the Cairo Museum, was found
(excavations of 1898-99). On more than one of these is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
a cartouche, a rectangle of deep blue, containing the
royal name, ‘inlaid’<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c018'><sup>[15]</sup></a> in several colours. One comparatively
large vase (several of them are as much as
eight inches in height) is decorated by three rosettes in
low relief. The twelve petals are of blue, green, and red
(the latter colour quite superficial) on a white ground.
Still more remarkable is a vase with galloping horses
and negroes; in this case the design is apparently inlaid
on the interior, and only seen through the transparent
body.</p>

<p class='c001' >The little pots for cosmetics, in the shape of truncated
cones, are usually made of a turquoise-glazed fayence.
Those of glass are very rare; one in the British Museum
is decorated on a nearly black base with splashes of white
enamel; this enamel is now suffering from some kind
of efflorescence and is falling off in scales. On another
fragment in the Glass-Room we find yellow and white
splashes on a black ground. This splashed ware is
characteristic, I think, of the later dynasties—the
twentieth and the twenty-first. We are reminded by it
of a similar application of enamel colours to glass that
was much in favour in France in the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p class='c001' >Apart from these little vases, the glass found in
Egypt is confined to pieces for inlay and to beads or
other small objects of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i>. For the inlay the
glass was rolled into slabs and cut out in the desired
shape, the surface also being often carved in low relief:
in later times the separate pieces were usually cast in
open moulds. Beside the colours commonly used in the
decoration of the vases, we find also an imitation of the
pale green felspar, and the use of a red paste is, as I have
said, more frequent. The individual pieces of the inlaid
designs—they generally represent hieroglyphics, and are
inserted into a basis of wood—are sometimes of a considerable
size; some kneeling figures of a late period,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
found near Tanis, are as much as four inches in height.
Mr. Griffith found here, among the ruins of houses
dating from early Ptolemaic times, some traces of glass-works,
which allow us to supplement in a measure what
we know of the manufacture in more remote periods. It
may be remarked, however, that on the one hand no
vases of the old chevron type were discovered—and this
is true, I think, of all the finds of glass from later deposits
in Egypt—nor on the other hand, as far as I am aware,
have any specimens of blown glass been found even
among Ptolemaic remains. At Tanis were found many
small moulds of terra-cotta and limestone into which the
molten glass was run—so, at least, says Mr. Griffith
(<cite>Egyptian Exploration Fund. Tell Nebeshah. 1888</cite>).
In earlier times, at any rate, the process seems rather to
have been to press down into the moulds little pellets
of glass in a pasty state.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the Glass-Room at the British Museum may be
seen an interesting collection of this later glass of
Ptolemaic or perhaps Roman date, found at Denderah.
There are many fragments of glass paste destined probably
to be fitted into hollows cut in a wooden plaque, the
intervening surface being covered with gilt <i>gesso</i>. Here,
as at Tanis, the colours are practically the same as those
found in the Eighteenth Dynasty glass, with the addition
only of the orange-yellow tint to which I have already
referred. It is in the centre of these wooden plaques
that what are perhaps the largest pieces of Egyptian glass
known to us are found. These are the scarabæi of
opaque blue glass, at times so closely resembling <i>lapis
lazuli</i> that their true nature has been in dispute. Even
the white marblings and spots of the native stone are
imitated; indeed, in one specimen in the collection of
Mr. Hilton Price, the little grains of pyrites in the stone,
so much admired by the ancients, have been imitated by
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paillettes</span></i> of gold scattered in the paste. (Cf. the passage
from Theophrastus quoted below, p. <a href='#Page_35'>35</a>.)</p>

<p class='c001' >But the Egyptians made use also of other processes
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
partaking of the nature both of inlay and mosaic.
Taking advantage of the fact that pieces of glass when
softened by heat adhere to one another—they are in fact
in this condition as ‘sticky’ as partially melted sugar—they
formed a mosaic of small rods of glass; these were
heated to a plastic condition, and if desired drawn out to
reduce the dimension of the design; when cold, transverse
sections were cut, on each of which the pattern appeared.
In other cases the design was excavated on the surface of
the glass, the coloured paste pressed into the hollows
when in a soft condition, and the whole plaque finally
reheated so as to form a homogeneous mass. Some such
process, at least, must have been adopted in the preparation
of the large slabs, generally with a ground of deep
blue glass, of which a fine series may be seen in the
Egyptian department of the British Museum. Elaborate
work of this kind dates for the most part from Ptolemaic
and even Roman times. Similar processes we shall
come across again, in the case of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">millefiori</span></i> glass and
the inlaid wall-plates of the Romans.</p>

<p class='c019' >It is but a comparatively small number of the little
glass vases with chevron patterns in our collections that
have come from Egypt; up to the present time, however,
no trace of their manufacture has been found in any other
country; and although we cannot attribute so early a date
as the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt to any of the little
glass jugs and amphoræ found in Greek and Etruscan
tombs, this ‘Mediterranean’ glass is in every respect
subsidiary to the Egyptian series.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Glass in the Mycenæan Age</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >It would, indeed, be quite beside the mark to make a
separate division for the glass of the Greeks, who for one
reason or another appear never to have found much
attraction in the material. This would at least seem to
have been the case in Greece itself during the great
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
centuries of Greek art, for nearly all the specimens of
glass that we have from tombs of that time have been
brought from more or less outlying lands, from Southern
Italy, Sardinia or Etruria, above all from the islands of
Rhodes and Cyprus, where the older culture long survived,
and where Phœnician and Egyptian influences
were strong.</p>

<p class='c001' >Such a statement, however, would not hold for the
so-called Mycenæan Age. At that time glass was indeed
a rare material brought by Phœnician merchants from
Egypt, perhaps from Syria also. In some cases this
imported glass may have been remelted and worked up
again; it was certainly highly prized.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c018'><sup>[16]</sup></a> Perhaps the most
striking instance of the application of glass to decorative
purposes in Greece itself at this period, is to be found
in the famous frieze discovered by Schliemann in the
vestibule of the men’s hall at Tiryns. The pattern,
carved in low relief upon the alabaster slabs, was
heightened by studs of blue glass fixed into these slabs
at intervals. Some of the roundels of this glass, forming
the centre of rosettes, are as much as three-quarters of an
inch in diameter. We have the authority of Virchow
for stating that this is a soda-lime glass, coloured by
copper—an analysis showed no trace of cobalt. On
the other hand, cobalt has been found by German chemists
in beads of an otherwise similar composition from
Mycenæ and from the bee-hive tombs of Attica.</p>

<p class='c001' >Now the question has arisen: Is this glass inlay to
be identified with the <i>kyanos</i> which, as Homer tells us,
formed the frieze or cornice
(θριγκός)
round the bronze
walls in the palace of Alkinoos? Helbig, writing before
the discovery of the frieze at Tiryns, maintained that the
poet’s <i>kyanos</i> was of a glassy nature. He tells us (<cite>Das
Homerische Epos</cite>, pp. 79 <i>seq.</i>, quoted in Schliemann’s
<cite>Tiryns</cite>)—‘This kyanos must be identified not with blue
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
steel, but with (1st) the later
Σαπφειρός—<i>lapis lazuli</i>;
(2nd)
with the blue colour obtained by pulverising this stone,
and finally with the artificial imitation of this stone or of
ultramarine. The classical passage is in Theophrastus
(<cite>On Stones</cite>, § 55). This author distinguishes between
the natural
αὐτοφυής
and the artificial
(σκευαστός)
<i>kyanos</i>.
That by the first <i>lapis lazuli</i> is intended appears from an
another passage (§ 39), where the gold dust distinctive of
the <i>lapis lazuli</i> is cited as the peculiarity of the natural
<i>kyanos</i>.... Theophrastus continues—“There are three
kinds of kyanos, the Egyptian, the Scythian, and the
Cyprian. The best for the darker colour is the Egyptian,
for the lighter, the Scythian. The Egyptian is artificially
prepared, and those that write about the kings tell us
which king first, to imitate natural kyanos, melted the
prepared kyanos
(Κυάνος χυτός),
and they allege that, among
other things, from Phœnicia came a tribute of kyanos,
partly natural and partly burnt
(τοῦ μὲν ἀπυροῦ τοῦ δὲ πεπυρωμένου).”’</p>

<p class='c001' >Helbig goes on to identify the unfired kyanos
with the copper ore of Cyprus—the blue carbonate which
the Phœnicians brought to the Pharaohs, and which was
the main source of copper for the Eastern Mediterranean.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c018'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >At Mycenæ itself little glass has been found—some
minute tubular beads, decomposed externally but with a
core of blue glass (pronounced by Landerer to contain
lead and cobalt), and a few beads of clear glass. In the
bee-hive tombs of Attica, especially at Spata, were found
a number of small objects of glass, cast, says M. Tsountas,
in moulds of granite and basalt which have been discovered
on the spot. Indeed in all these tombs, next to
the beads, the commonest examples of glass are the little
rosettes and plaques cast in a mould with a design in low
relief; these rosettes are often pierced with holes and
were probably sewn on to the dresses of the women. The
surface, and sometimes the whole body, is decomposed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
presenting a white silvery glimmer, and this appearance
Landerer considers to be characteristic of the presence of
lead in the glass. At Vaphio we hear of fragments of
glass ‘goblets’ being found, decorated with spirals of
black, chestnut, and yellow (Tsountas and Manatt, <cite>The
Mycenæan Age</cite>, 1897). If these are to be identified with
our chevron vases, it is, as far as I know, the only mention
of their occurrence on the mainland of Greece at this
time.</p>

<p class='c001' >But it is from the Greco-Phœnician tombs of Cyprus
and Rhodes that the greatest quantity of this primitive
glass (chiefly in the form of <i>unguentaria</i>) has been
obtained; again from Greco-Etruscan tombs in Tuscany,
from what may be called Greco-Oscan tombs in Southern
Italy, and even from Greco-Scythian tombs in Southern
Russia—from, in fact, nearly all the lands visited by
Phœnician traders. How widely spread was the acquaintance
with these little vases we may infer from the
imitations of the chevron pattern on coloured pottery
found in Melos. A similar decoration has been found
on Lydian pottery from tumuli near Sardis, and even,
it is claimed, upon prehistoric pottery brought from the
Nilghery Hills in Southern India.</p>

<p class='c001' >These little vases now take characteristic Greek
shapes. The columnar kohl-pots are replaced by
alabastra, very similar in form. Even more common in
later tombs are the little <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">amphoræ</span></i>, sometimes pointed at
the base, at others ending in a rounded knob; a jug-shaped
form like the Greek <i>oinochoe</i> is also common.
In some cases—in specimens of Egyptian origin very
frequently—the surface of the glass is entirely unchanged.
But when the decay of the surface has once set in, we
generally find that the decomposition has eaten deeply
into the substance of the glass (see above, p. <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>). In
such cases it often happens that the blue colour has been
entirely removed, and the vase has assumed the appearance
of a dull, whitish pottery.</p>

<p class='c001' >I will now briefly mention a few abnormal types of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
decoration. On some little amphoræ from Southern
Italy the chevrons are of a manganese purple on a white
translucent ground—this colour appears never to be combined
with the more frequent blues and yellows. I have
already noted that the use of red is very rare; where it
appears, the technique of the vase appears to be different—the
surface has probably been ground or turned on a
lathe. A beautiful alabastron in the Slade collection, with
red ground decorated with turquoise and yellow chevrons,
should be specially noticed. (See also Pl <span class='fss'>II</span>, 2.)</p>

<p class='c001' >How much these little vases were valued appears
from the stands of gold (decorated with applied spirals of
an early type) on which they were sometimes placed in
the tombs. M. Reinach mentions some instances from
Crimean tombs, where chevron vases of the usual type
have been found attached by a fine chain of gold to the
bracelet worn by the deceased (Tolstoi and Kondakof,
<cite>Antiquités de la Russie Méridionale</cite>, 1891). The little
bottles that we see in the hand of the recumbent effigy on
Phœnician sarcophagi, are probably to be identified with
our glass vases; we have an instance of this on the well-known
female figure in the Palermo Museum (figured by
Perrot and Chipiez and elsewhere).</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Later Survivals of the Primitive Glass</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >There are in the British Museum some little glass
amphoræ from Camirus and Ialysus in Rhodes, and
others from Amathia and Salamis in Cyprus, on which
the chevron bands are not incorporated into the glass
base, but laid on the surface as in later enamelled ware.
The chevrons in such cases cannot have been ‘dragged’
by the old ingenious plan; they must have been elaborately
applied one by one. We may recognise probably
in such cases the survival of an old method of decoration
after the technical process by which it was produced had
been lost. The glass itself, too, is of a late type—transparent
and hastily formed. I think that the date of some
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
of these ‘scamped’ chevron vases may be later than is
generally thought.</p>

<p class='c001' >The beads and other objects of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i> from the
Cyprian and Rhodian tombs differ much from those found
in the Mycenæan sepulchres of Continental Greece.
There are in the British Museum some large beads of
perfectly clear glass from Ialysus in Rhodes<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c018'><sup>[18]</sup></a>; these are
probably of Asiatic origin. We must also range with
this ‘primitive’ glass the large beads—if beads they are
to be called—in the form of satyr-like masks, so widely
spread through Mediterranean lands (<a href='#p15'>Pl. <span class='fss'>XV.</span></a>, 1), as well
as those of irregular shape that so closely resemble the
old ‘bull’s eye’ sweetmeats, built up of interlacing bands
of various colours. Indeed the technique of the manufacture
of these beads was probably very similar to that
of those handmade ‘lollipops,’ for in spite of its lower
fusing-point, and of its solubility in water, there are many
points of resemblance between sugar in a state of semi-fusion
and glass in a similar condition.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c018'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >What little I have to say of the rare specimens of
glass of a more advanced type found in Greek tombs, I
will postpone to the next chapter.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Primitive Glass of Western Asia</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >The civilisation of the inhabitants of the Euphrates
valley reaches probably as far back as that of the Egyptians.
Its influence has extended at various times from
the Balkan peninsula to the borders of India, including
Persia on the one hand, and on the other the kingdoms
that grew up in Syria, and among the primitive races of
Asia Minor. Now, if we are to judge by the contents of
our museums, all these lands, at least up to the time of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
the conquest of Alexander, may be passed over as of no
concern to the writer of a history of glass. If, however,
we allow ourselves to be influenced by less material
evidence, we shall find that a good case may be made out
for the early existence of glass in these lands. But
before discussing this evidence, I would impress upon
the reader how much the survival of objects of glass
depends upon the habit of burying in tombs, and their
discovery upon the systematic exploration of these tombs.
Compared with Egypt, how little has been accomplished
in this way in these Western Asiatic countries!</p>

<p class='c001' >I have already noticed the coincidence of the sudden
development of the manufacture of glass in Egypt with
the first close contact, at the period of the Eighteenth
Dynasty, of the Egyptians with races already affected by
Babylonian culture; and we must remember that the
glass made within a few years of this first contact was
never surpassed in later times. Nor must we overlook
the classical tradition concerning the invention of glass
handed down to us by Pliny and other writers. According
to this tradition, glass was first made by Phœnician
traders on the coast of Syria. Here, at any rate, the
three great requisites for the manufacture were at hand—a
pure silica in the convenient form of a white sand,
alkali either from the ashes of marine plants or from
adjacent salt deposits, and finally, an abundant supply of
fuel. And yet, for the present, all that can be said is
that we must associate all the early glass that has been
found in other countries than Egypt with the trading
peoples of the Eastern Mediterranean, whether Pelasgians,
Carians, or Phœnicians. To a similar source we
may refer the rare glass beads found in tombs of the
bronze period in Western Europe, as well perhaps as the
scanty specimens of glass that have come from Assyria
and Persia. To these last we will now turn.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of glass of undoubted Assyrian origin, by far the
most important example known to us is the little barrel-shaped
vase with stunted handles found so many years
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
ago by the late Sir Henry Layard in the ruins of Kouyunjik.
This little vessel, after many vicissitudes, has
found its way into the British Museum. It is three and
a quarter inches in height, and is formed of a glass that
is perfectly white and nearly transparent; it still remains,
indeed, our earliest example of such glass. The date is
fixed to the latter part of the seventh century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, by an
inscription cut in cuneiform characters containing the
name of Sargon, together with his titles as king of
Assyria; on it is also engraved the figure of a lion.
Layard speaks of this vase as being shaped and hollowed
on a turner’s lathe after being ‘<em>blown in one solid piece</em>’
(<cite>Nineveh and Babylon</cite>, 1853)—a curious expression for
one who interested himself so much in the manufacture
of glass! We may, perhaps, regard it as having been
carved like an object of rock crystal out of a solid piece
of glass. We know of nothing like it from Egypt, but
then the Egyptians had no love for transparent, colourless
materials; from an early time, as we have seen, they had
covered their beads of rock crystal with a blue glaze
(cf. p. <a href='#Page_20'>20</a>). Here I may add that the other specimens
of glass discovered by Layard at Nineveh have no claim
to so early a date. Among them, however, were two
bowls of great interest, formed of a <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetro di trina</span></i> or ‘lace
glass,’ with very fine meshes. These are now in the
Assyrian Department of the British Museum. Some
almost identical bowls from the late Greek tombs of
Canosa, in Southern Italy, may be seen in the Glass-Room
in the same Museum.</p>

<p class='c001' >The Assyrians and the Babylonians before them were,
we know, from an early date past masters in the manufacture
of coloured glazes. The turquoise blue glaze of
their pottery and wall tiles has been handed down in
these lands apparently without a break, through Persian
and Sassanian times to their later Arab masters. In the
Louvre are some slabs of a translucent glass of a fine
turquoise tint, about three inches square, and three-quarters
of an inch in thickness, which were found in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
Babylonia, associated apparently with objects of great age.
Such masses of glass paste were perhaps manufactured
as articles of commerce to be employed afterwards in the
preparation of glazes.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c018'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Apart from these examples, the glass brought from
Western Asia is of the usual later Phœnician or Roman
type—‘lachrymatories’ and bowls mostly of greenish
glass. It is not till we come to Sassanian times that
we can find any distinctive features, and the rare specimens
dating from that period will best be treated in a
later chapter along with the contemporary Byzantine glass.
I may mention finally that there are one or two passages
in our Greek classics that may point to the use of glass
by the Persians in the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> For instance,
among other hardships suffered by the Athenian embassy
to the great king—so we are told ironically by Aristophanes
in his <cite>Acharnians</cite>—they were forced to drink
from vessels of gold and from <em>cups of glass</em>, or, may be,
of rock crystal
(ἐξ ὑαλίνων ἐκπωμάτων).</p>

<p class='c001' >We know of no glass other than that of Roman type
from the Bible lands, using that expression in the
narrower sense, nor in the whole literature of the
Hebrews is there, as far as I know, any definite reference
to glass. The word <i>Zechuchoth</i>, which occurs in a
passage of Job (xxviii. 17), is translated in the Vulgate by
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitrum</span></i>, but like the Greek
ὕαλος,
it may as well refer to
rock crystal, or any other hard transparent substance.
There is, however, a passage in Jeremiah (ii. 22) which is
really of more interest to us. It begins, ‘For though
thou wash thee with nitre and take thee much soap.’
From this passage we learn at least that the natron of
the salt lakes was in early days applied to practical ends.
This was one step to its application to the manufacture
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
of glass. Since then the soap-boiler has often been the
ally of the glass-maker.</p>

<p class='c001' >I have thought it well to bring together these few
facts and theories bearing upon the early knowledge and
use of glass in Western Asia, for could its early existence
in these lands be once definitely established, we
should be better able to fill up a gap in our history,
and it would perhaps be then possible to solve that
obscure problem—<em>When and where was the great step
taken and the blowing-tube first made use of for the
production of a vesicle or paraison of glass?</em></p>

<p class='c001' >At the present day, in some of the villages around
Hebron, glass is still made by very primitive processes.
Thence come the many-coloured bangles of glass, dear
to the Arab women of Palestine and Egypt; some of
these have found their way into collections of Egyptian
antiquities, so closely do they resemble the old wares.
This glass is carried by Arab and Jewish pedlars as far,
it is said, as the Soudan. Here, indeed, we have an
industry that may well be regarded as a survival from
very early days.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c018'><sup>[21]</sup></a> On the other hand, some two thousand
years ago, as we learn from the evidence of the tombs,
blown glass of an advanced type, colourless and transparent,
was a common article in daily use, not only on
the Syrian coast, but at Nazareth and other Galilean
towns (see below, <a href='#ch04'>Chap. <span class='fss'>IV.</span></a>); and yet, as far as I know,
there is not a single allusion to glass or glass-making in
any of our four Gospels.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c018'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_8 c006'     >So far, all the glass with which we have come in
contact has belonged without exception to one
family; small objects, generally brightly coloured—beads,
ornaments of various kinds and shapes, and,
above all, little vases decorated with chevron bands; all
these things belong rather to what in a general way may
be classed as jewellery, objects of personal decoration. Of
the one essential application of glass, as we understand
the term, we have not so far found a single undoubted
example—its application, I mean, to vessels intended to
hold wine or water. This was to come a little later, and
to come with a rush, as it were; for by the first century
of our era, glass had already taken a position at least as
important as at any subsequent time in our history.</p>

<p class='c001' >I am speaking of glass, of course, in the narrow sense
of the word, especially as a receptacle for liquids, for wine
in the first place. From this time onward this is the
predominant service to which the material has been put,
and, indeed, at no time was its relation to wine-drinking
more intimate than among the Romans of the early
empire.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is certainly strange that in spite of our comparatively
intimate acquaintance with the ways of life
of the Greeks during the time that intervened between
the conquests of Alexander and the period of their
absorption in the Roman Empire, we should be in
possession of no evidence, documentary or material,
that would throw light on this, for us, most important
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
of all questions: Where was it, and at what time, that
the great discovery was made—the art of blowing glass?
For it was thanks to this discovery that the material
came for the first time to take an important place among
the art products and even the industries of the day.
This is a point that cannot be too often or too strongly
impressed upon the reader.</p>

<p class='c001' >The glass vessels of the ancients rarely bear any
inscription, and there is little, as a rule, in the decoration
that can give occupation to the antiquary. Classical
glass has therefore been comparatively neglected, except
when of superlative merit; the record of its <i>provenance</i>
has generally been lost: in continental museums it has
either found a back place on the shelves of the Greek and
Roman collections, or it has been handed over <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></i>
to other departments. We thus find crowded together
in the same case delicately turned bowls from Greek
tombs, cinerary urns from Gaul or Britain, and examples
of the rudely carved and engraved glass of the third and
fourth centuries.</p>

<p class='c001' >Such little evidence as there is, especially a few
passages in Roman writers, would point to Alexandria,
above all other towns, as the principal home of the glass
industry in the first centuries before our era. We know,
however, of no find of blown glass in Egypt, previous
to later Roman or Coptic times. The Ptolemaic glass
found at Tanis and elsewhere differs, as we have seen,
little from the old type; and even at what is probably a
later period we have found the same old type of glass in
use at Denderah for inlaying (see above, p. <a href='#Page_32'>32</a>). It was not
the Egyptians themselves that favoured the new process—by
them the new glass was doubtless rejected as something
exotic and unholy. The Greeks, on the other hand,
seem never to have taken any interest in the material—the
‘fused stone,’ as they called it, was at the best but
a poor substitute for the native minerals that it imitated.</p>

<p class='c001' >I have already pointed out that the Greeks had at

century, where the same word is used, the reference is
apparently to vessels of glass. We hear, too, of seals of
glass
(σφραγῖδες ὑάλιναι)
in similar inscriptions of the
same date. The word
ὕαλον
ultimately became the equivalent
of the Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitrum</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c001' >In any case, it is from Greek tombs of the Hellenistic
period that we obtain our earliest specimens of glass,
other than the small articles of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i> that formed
the exclusive subject-matter of the last chapter. There
have been preserved a few rare bowls of transparent
glass, sometimes quite colourless, or more often stained
with blue or with a honey-like tint resembling that of
the hyacinth or the sard. These bowls are distinguished
by the purity of their outline; they have apparently been
finished on a lathe, but whether the glass was originally
simply cast, or, as is possible, <em>blown into</em> a mould, it is
impossible to say. The only ornament consists in one
or more incised lines near the margin. A few of these
bowls have been obtained in Athens, others come from
tombs in the south of Italy,—we have unfortunately no
means of fixing the date in either case. It is rather from
the refinement of their curves and the restraint in the
decoration that we are led to class them as pre-Roman.</p>

<p class='c001' >But it is from the glass found in the tombs of Canosa
that we can form the best idea of what the Greeks of
Ptolemaic times were capable in this direction, and we
are fortunate in having in London a remarkable series of
glass vessels from these tombs. Canusium was one of
the few cities of Apulia that preserved much of its Greek
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
culture as well as the partial use of the Greek language
well into the time of the Roman Empire. The beautiful
specimens in the Glass-Room in the British Museum,
some of them so thoroughly Hellenic in character, are
referred to the first century of our era, but in general
character and feeling, as well as in their shapes, they
reflect the art of an earlier period. A bowl of pure white
glass—the sharp outlines, especially of the solid handles,
show that it was finished by a cutting tool—is of a form
(the
σκύφος
of the Greeks) well known both in pottery and
metal ware. The two graceful bowls, decorated in gold
with an exquisite design of acanthus leaves, combined
with a small plant with tendrils, both radiating from a
central flower, even in their present condition, perhaps
surpass in beauty any other known example of ancient
glass. From the technical side, the marvellous skill with
which the two shells of glass of which these bowls are
built up, are fitted together, should be carefully noted.
It will be observed that the inner shell projects considerably
beyond the outer one, and that the latter at the line
of junction has been apparently levelled down by subsequent
grinding. How far the two layers have been
soldered together by subsequent firing, it would be
difficult to say. Between the two shells, the gold leaf
that forms the base of the decoration has been applied.
We are reminded (but <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">longo intervallo</span></i>, not only artistically
but technically also) both of the so-called cemetery
glass of later date, and of the ‘doubled glasses’ made in
the eighteenth century in Bohemia.</p>

<p class='c001' >Scarcely less remarkable are the other examples of
glass from Canosa exhibited in the same case. Here
may be seen two bowls built up with coils of little
rods, each rod containing an opaque white string in
the centre of a clear base; these, as I have mentioned,
are identical with the bowls, now in the Assyrian
Department, brought back by Layard from Nineveh. In
addition to these varied types of glass there were found
in the same tombs some large dishes of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">millefiori</span></i> ware,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
and finally a large flat bowl of white glass with a somewhat
rude pattern cut with the wheel, and with a row of
spurs projecting from near the edge. This, as will be
seen further on, is a method of decoration more common
at a time of artistic decline, in the third and fourth
centuries.</p>

<p class='c001' >Quite Greek in character are the strange little unguent
pots that come from Cyprus. On the cup-like overlapping
lid of one in the British Museum may be seen
outlined in black, apparently between two layers of glass,
a little cupid bearing a bunch of grapes. Although many
of these little pots have lately been found in Cyprus, it
is only in a few cases that the design on the lid, so truly
Greek in style, has been preserved.</p>

<p class='c001' >There is some reason to believe that when the use of
the blowing-tube was first introduced it was applied as
a supplement to a moulding process. The hollow vesicle
of glass—the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paraison</span></i>, to use the old French word—was
blown into a more or less hemispherical mould, and the
irregularities of the resulting bowl were then removed
by grinding on a wheel. At any rate, during what we
may call the Alexandrian period, a bowl of simple outline,
whether shallow or deep, is the characteristic form. In
the case of certain dishes in the shape of a boat, the
wheel has played a still more important part.</p>

<p class='c001' >For the personal adornment of their women the
Greeks continued to make a variety of small objects of
glass, more or less on the old lines. We find, too,
intaglios engraved on glass of various and often most
exquisite tints at least as early as the fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
In the preparation of these pastes the greatest attention
was paid to the exact imitation of precious stones. At a
somewhat later date, in the second century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, cameos in
high relief cast in glass pastes of various colours came
into vogue. The ‘mother’ design was modelled in clay,
and upon this matrix the mould in which the glass was
to be cast was formed. These early glass cameos are
compared by the late Dr. Murray to the circular, moulded
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
reliefs on the black pottery of this period, and he
points out that they apparently preceded the large reliefs
engraved on stones of the onyx family which were so
much in favour a little later (<cite>Greek Archæology</cite>, p. 160).
It must be borne in mind that neither in the case of
cameo or intaglio could the paste copy be made directly
from the original stone. The paste gem, thus moulded,
was often carefully finished by hand.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Early Roman Glass</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >In the absence of any continuous series of glass
vessels that can be classed as Greek, it would seem
somewhat of a contradiction to say that the artistic glass
of the Romans was founded upon examples distinctly
Greek in outline and decoration. And yet there can be
no doubt that in the earlier period, at any rate, the source
of inspiration of the Roman glass-maker was the same as
that of the contemporary potter or bronze-worker. At
the time when objects of glass were first brought to
Italy in the ships of the Greek traders, we may be certain
that the places where this glass was made—whether these
be sought at Alexandria or at one or more of the cities of
the Phœnician coast—had been completely Hellenised.
Again, the new material found its way in through towns
which, if not Greek speaking, were thoroughly Greek in
culture, through Cumæ—in the neighbourhood of this
city glass was probably first made in Italy—and through
the semi-Greek towns of Apulia. But in one important
respect this Greek glass differed from the contemporary
bronze and pottery. It was to the Greeks a new art with
few old traditions, and these not of Hellenic origin. In
the first century before Christ the industry was only beginning
to be of any importance. It thus came about that
in a greater degree than perhaps any other branch of
ancient art, the manufacture of glass may be regarded as
an art essentially Roman. This fact may help to account
for the extreme poverty of the material for its history and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
methods of manufacture to be found in Roman writers.
There were in this case no Greek authorities for these
writers to fall back upon. Compare the meagre and
confused narrative of Pliny in the brief section that he
devotes to glass with his detailed, and in a measure
scholarly, accounts in other departments of the arts where
he could borrow from earlier Greek technical treatises.</p>

<p class='c001' >The glass that we know as Roman was made for a
period of about four hundred years. It was manufactured
at one time or another in nearly every country into which
the Romans penetrated, from Syria and Mesopotamia on
the one hand, to Spain and Britain on the other. It has
even been found in the tombs of tribes that the Romans
never subdued, as in Denmark and Sweden. There is
scarcely an application of glass known in Europe in the
eighteenth century that was not known also to the
Romans, and they were masters of the various processes
by which glass may be decorated.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Millefiori Glass</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >M. Froehner, in his introduction to the catalogue of
the Charvet collection, has divided Roman glass into as
many as fifteen classes. Some of these divisions are perhaps
rather arbitrary, and very little success has attended
any attempt made by him or by other writers on the
subject to classify the vast material on a geographical
basis, still less to trace the history of its development.</p>

<p class='c001' >There is, however, one division of classical glass—we
can hardly call it Roman, although most of the finer
specimens may be traced back to Rome or to the tombs
of Central and Southern Italy—which forms in some
degree a transition from our primitive family to the true
blown glass of imperial times. This is the so-called
Millefiori Glass. We have, doubtless, in this a development
of the ‘fused mosaics’ of the Egyptians, worked
out on a larger scale, and employed for other objects than
flat slabs and fragments for inlay.</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
In the millefiori bowls of Greco-Roman times we
can distinguish two predominant types: the madrepore
design in the first place, which closely imitates the
pattern on a polished slab of coralline limestone, with the
addition that the ground is of a deep translucent green
or of a purple of subdued tone. In this class may be
placed such exceptional pieces as the bowl from Crete, in
the British Museum; here we have rosettes of yellow,
green, and red upon an opaque ground of a rich blue.
The second type is equally characteristic, but more difficult
to describe. Short, loosely rolled scrolls of an
opaque white float in a more or less transparent base,
interspersed with a few quadrangular masses of gilt glass.
It would be difficult to say what natural substance is
imitated in this case—perhaps some kind of fossiliferous
<i>lumachella</i> marble, which may have been in vogue at one
time at Alexandria. We may be quite sure that the
Roman glass-workers would not have failed to imitate
the famous Murrhine vases, which seem to have been
originally carved from a natural stone, and it is among
the millefiori glasses that such imitations may probably
be looked for.</p>

<p class='c001' >These millefiori bowls are evidently built up with
more or less spirally arranged fragments of glass
mosaic,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c018'><sup>[23]</sup></a> the individual pieces having been probably cut
from a cane of glass, itself formed by a combination of
minute rods, as in the case of the Egyptian ‘fused
mosaics.’ These pieces were arranged in the mould in a
coil, starting from the centre, but how far, if at all, during
the subsequent partial fusion, they were subjected to any
blowing operation, is a moot point. In any case, the
final effect is the result of an elaborate process of cutting
on the wheel and subsequent polishing.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>ROMAN MILLEFIORI GLASS BOWLS, IMITATING NATIVE STONES
</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c001' >In this millefiori glass the sections of the canes are
arranged with a studied irregularity (so as, in a measure,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
to mask the spiral arrangement), and a further variety is
given by setting up many of them obliquely to the surface.
On the other hand we can seldom, perhaps never,
find any trace of the distortion, which would inevitably
be caused by the subsequent use of the blowing-tube.
In other cases, the individual fragments may be built up
of irregular longitudinal bands, so as to give the general
effect of an agate breccia, as in a fine bowl at South
Kensington. When the contorted bands are continuous
we have another important type, founded apparently upon
the endless varieties of banded agate and other native
stones that have been formed by slow deposition in the
hollows of rocks. One variety imitates amethystine quartz,
but here, as elsewhere, rich combinations of colour, which
can have no prototype among natural stones, are often
introduced. We have an exceptionally beautiful example
of this in certain cigar-shaped alabastra, said to
have come from Sidon. Meandering bands of emerald
green, powdered with gold, are divided by lines of white
and deep blue. Good examples of this ‘peacock’ decoration
may be found in the British Museum, at South
Kensington, and in the Gréau collection.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c018'><sup>[24]</sup></a> Allied to these,
and still more rare, are the little globular bottles with
bands of green and gold, of which there are exquisite
specimens in both our great Museums.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the Etruscan Museum of Gregory <span class='fss'>XVI.</span> in the
Vatican, the millefiori glass is well represented by a
series of bowls from Greek and Etruscan tombs. There
is a choice collection of fragments of millefiori and
banded glass in the British Museum,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c018'><sup>[25]</sup></a> and a still larger
one in the Industrial Museum at Vienna.</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
A broken fragment of glass will indeed often tell us
more than a complete vase. We can, for example, see from
it whether the pattern passes continuously through the
whole thickness of the glass, or whether it has been inlaid,
or perhaps pressed into the surface when hot. In
one case we have a process that reminds us of mosaic
work; in the other there is some approach to a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">champlevé</span></i>
enamel, only with a base of glass instead of metal.
In some rare examples we find the glass inlay surrounded
by a fine ribbon of gold, suggesting the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cloisonné</span></i>
enamels of the Byzantine jeweller. There is a minute
example of this delicate work in the Slade collection
(<cite>Catalogue</cite>, Pl. <span class='fss'>III.</span> No. 4).</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Colours of Roman Glass</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >It is evident that the Romans had at their command
a full gamut of colours, both transparent and opaque,
obtained from iron, copper, manganese, and antimony—the
same metals, in fact, as the Egyptians made use of.
But their deep transparent blue they probably obtained,
in most cases, from cobalt, a metal unknown to the latter
people.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c018'><sup>[26]</sup></a> There was one great deficiency, however, in
their palette. They were never able to obtain a transparent
red. The ruby red derived from copper or from
gold was known to the early mediæval alchemists, but no
undoubted instance of the use of this valuable colour has
been observed in glass of the classical period.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c018'><sup>[27]</sup></a> The
nearest approach to a transparent red is to be found in
the honey and brown-red tints resembling the sard and
the hyacinth; colours such as these are derived chiefly
from iron, and may pass, on the one hand, into a pale
yellow, and on the other into various shades of olive-green.
The opaque red glass containing a large percentage
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
of the basic oxide of copper and also some oxide of tin,<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c018'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
was much admired by the Romans; it was probably the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitrum hæmatinon</span></i> of Pliny. In the Gréau collection is
a head of Neptune in this material, of considerable
artistic merit; to this head the oxidation of the surface
has given the appearance of a finely patinated bronze.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Wall Decoration of Glass</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >Before going on to speak of the blown glass of the
Romans, it will be well to say something of another
application of glass that found favour among them at one
time. This consisted in the decoration of the surface of
walls, and in a few rare cases of pavements, by slabs of
glass of various colours.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c018'><sup>[29]</sup></a> We may, perhaps, trace a
double origin for this use of the material. On the one
hand, it but carried out more fully the decoration of wall
surfaces by rosettes and other patterns, both of glass and
of glazed pottery, a plan often adopted by the Egyptians.
This style was imitated with the little plaques of glass
inlay, of which so many fragments have been found among
the vineyards in the neighbourhood of Rome.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c018'><sup>[30]</sup></a> On the
other hand, slabs of glass were used to imitate the veneer
of porphyry and other marbles, so much in use in Rome
in the first and second centuries. The two favourite
stones, the red Egyptian porphyry with white spots and
the green <i>Serpentino</i> from the Taygetus range with large,
whitish crystals of felspar, were admirably imitated in
slabs of glass often of large size; of these many important
specimens may be seen in the British Museum. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
method of decoration must have been introduced at
Rome at a comparatively early date, if we are to accept
the usual interpretation of the passage where Pliny describes
the application of glass to the exterior of the
theatre built by Scaurus at the beginning of the first
century before Christ.</p>

<p class='c001' >The best known examples of this glass veneering
come from the ruins of a building some four miles to the
north of Rome, generally known as the Villa of Lucius
Verus; there are many fine pieces from this source in
our museums. In private houses this veneering of glass
was above all in favour for the bath-chamber. ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vitro
absconditur camera</span></i>’ says Seneca, instancing this practice
as a sign of the advancing luxury of the age.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the earlier methods each slab or tile is built up of
pieces of glass of geometrical outline; in rarer cases the
adjacent pieces have been fused together or again pressed
into a base of glass by a plan similar to that formerly
used in Egypt. But when the individual pieces of glass
have been cut into shapes and then fitted together to
form the design, we have the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">opus sectile</span></i> of the Romans.
We are here dealing with something nearly approaching
in character to a true mosaic, and therefore outside the
limits we have given ourselves. But it is impossible to
pass over without mention the marvellous examples of
this class of work which covered the walls of the basilica
erected at Rome by Junius Bassus, consul in the year
317. Although this building no longer exists, important
remains of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">opus sectile</span></i> which once covered its walls
are preserved in a private palace at Rome, and some
smaller compartments may be seen in the Church of St.
Antonio Abbate on the Esquiline. These have been
described in a paper read by the late Mr. Nesbitt before
the Society of Antiquaries (<cite>Archæologia</cite>, vol. xlv.; see
especially the coloured plate <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span>). The main subjects,
indeed, and the ground are executed chiefly in coloured
marbles, but for us the most interesting part is the band
representing embroidery below the large picture of Hylas
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
and the Nymphs. This frieze of small figures is formed
entirely of glass, and it will be noticed that in this part
both the subject and the treatment are Egyptian. We
have here the copy of a wall-hanging—probably of one of
the heavy embroidered <i>tapetia Alexandrina</i>. It must
be borne in mind that although this work was nearly
contemporary with the Christian mosaics of the time of
Constantine, the designs must, in part at least, have been
copied from some earlier composition. The frieze of
figures indeed takes us back to the Egyptian renaissance
of Hadrian’s time.</p>

<p class='c001' >The glass of which the larger plaques of this Roman
veneer were made was probably poured out upon an
even surface, rolled while hot, and at times, but not
always, subsequently polished. It may be regarded as
a primitive form of what the French call <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre coulé</span></i>, a
term which includes our modern plate-glass. The thick
heavy glass that the Romans used for their slit-like
windows belongs to the same class; it is well known
that slabs of considerable size have been found in position
at Pompeii, but we are not concerned here with this
purely practical application of the material.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c018'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >The employment of glass for mirrors, although known
to the ancients, was, if we may judge from the few specimens
that have survived, only practised on a very small
scale. Pliny says that the Sidonians had applied glass
to this purpose, but he speaks of it rather as a curiosity
than as a matter of practical importance. Some little
circular mirrors of convex glass, about an inch and a half
in diameter, have lately been found in Greek or Greco-Roman
tombs at Arsinoe in Egypt. There is one in the
Musée Guimet at Paris, set in a silver frame with a ring
as if for suspension from a necklace. I do not know the
exact nature of the metallic backing (it is merely described
as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étamé</span></i>), but this is still quite brilliant. M. Garnier
mentions two mirrors mounted in wood from a tomb at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
Saqqarah; others of watch-glass shape, set in frames of
lead, have been found in Roman tombs at Ratisbon.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Moulded Glass</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >Two quite distinct applications of glass fall under this
head. When the glass paste, in a fluid or semi-fluid
condition, is pressed into a mould, we have a simple process
for making either imitations of cameos and intaglios
cut in precious stones, or again small articles of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i>
in no way differing from those produced by the peoples of
the Eastern Mediterranean from an early period. Most
of the work executed in this way in Roman times has little
claim to artistic merit or originality. Masks and busts
thus prepared were afterwards applied to the decoration of
other objects—furniture, or even metal ware<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c018'><sup>[32]</sup></a>—or they
were fused on to the sides of vessels of blown glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >Much attention was given to the imitation of precious
stones. In the British Museum is a remarkable series of
medallions and plaques in a paste made in imitation of
<i>lapis lazuli</i>, the <i>sapphirus</i> of the ancients. The colouring
matter in this case would appear to be the famous
Egyptian blue, which was certainly known to the Romans
(see p. <a href='#Page_27'>27</a>). In one example at least we can see that the
coloured paste only formed a coating upon a base of
ordinary glass, and this would point to the former being
a material of some value. The large plaque of this blue
paste, inscribed <span class='sc'>Bono Eventui</span>, seems to have been
finished with the tool, but we cannot look upon it as
throughout a work of the sculptor. Heads of the Medusa
or of Jupiter, viewed in full front so as to fill the roundel,
are the commonest type. The dark paste in which some
small portrait heads in the British Museum are cast is
probably an imitation of the rare black sard.</p>

<p class='c001' >I have now to speak of another class of moulded
glass, of what is, in fact, a true ‘hollow ware,’ made by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
blowing a vesicle of glass into a mould. This is the first
time that we unmistakably come across the use of the
blowing-tube. In the case of glass it is practically impossible
to use a mould in the shaping of a hollow vessel
without some such method of forcing the viscid material
into its place by pressure from the inside. I think, therefore,
that it is not unlikely that it was in connection with
some system of moulding that the blowing-tube was
first introduced. Thus combined, the process calls for
less manipulative skill than is required in the shaping of
the free <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paraison</span></i> by the glass-blower.</p>

<p class='c001' >Moulded ‘hollow ware’ was produced at a comparatively
early date in the East. Unfortunately we have no
means of determining whether the glass-blowers of Sidon
were acquainted with the process before the first century
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> By that date, at least, the little flasks, <i>unguentaria</i>
or what not, blown into moulds, had completely displaced
the primitive chevron bottles that had so long been in
favour. These moulded flasks are shaped in imitation
of various fruits—dates, bunches of grapes, pomegranates—again
the double scallop shell was a favourite pattern;
more rarely we find the head of a man or a woman,
especially of a negro. The glass is of various colours,
but a rich honey tint is the commonest.</p>

<p class='c001' >Another frequent type, especially to be connected with
the towns of the Phœnician coast, is to be found in the
little bottles, generally with eight panels round the body,
on which are impressed various implements connected
with the sacrifice, or at other times Bacchic emblems or
musical instruments. In one or two cases the reliefs
on these flasks have been thought to have reference to
the Jewish worship. These little octagonal bottles have
been found in various parts of the eastern basin of the
Mediterranean, as well as on the north shores of the
Black Sea. The glass of which they are made tends to
decompose to a white porcelain-like mass, without further
injury to the surface, a fact which would point to its
containing a certain amount of lead and perhaps of tin.

Here, for the first time in the history of glass, we come
across the name of the manufacturer—we can hardly say
the artist. It is, indeed, as might be expected, to the
moulded ware that we are indebted for the most important
of the scanty inscriptions that have been found on Roman
glass; of these I shall have something to say on a future
page. Such inscriptions in relief are above all prominent
on the only other type of moulded glass which I can find
space to mention. I refer to the cylindrical cups of thin
greenish glass, which were apparently given as prizes
for victory in various contests, or which perhaps merely
served as mementoes of the occasion. Among the most
interesting of this class is a series of glasses of which
the best examples have been found in England; these
are surrounded by double or triple zones, showing in
relief chariot-races or combats of gladiators. All are of
late date, and are of no merit as works of art. On one,
exceptionally perfect, found near Colchester, and now
in the British Museum, above the two bands of reliefs
showing the rival chariots rounding the critical point at
the extremity of the <i>spina</i>, the inscription <span class='sc'>Crescens
Ave—Hierax Vale</span> would seem to celebrate the victory
of the first-named charioteer, but it may perhaps only
express the hopes of Crescens’ backer.</p>

<p class='c001' >The moulded hollow glass of the Romans often calls
to mind the red Samian pottery decorated with reliefs, to
which it is, however, as a whole inferior in artistic merit.
The material does not lend itself well to elaborate
designs, and one misses the crisp outlines given to
glass by the cutting-tool. There is generally an air as
of a cheap and second-hand copy, which gives a very
modern aspect to many of these moulded pieces, and this
is above all the case when the glass is transparent.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c018'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 id='ch04' class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />THE BLOWN GLASS OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_8 c006'     >It is after all in the development of the art of blowing
glass that the principal merit of the glass-workers,
in the age immediately preceding our era, is to
be found. By this method the real capabilities of the
material, both practical and artistic, were first disclosed.
The art was probably first practised on the Phœnician
coast, perhaps at Sidon, not long after the time of
Alexander. Beside the moulded flasks of which I have
spoken above, there are others of plain globular form,
with simple short necks, which we may perhaps look
upon as among the earliest work of the Phœnician glass-blowers.
Some of these are little more than spherical
vesicles of the glass as it came from the blowing-tube.
With these are associated certain plain spheres of thin
glass of various colours, which may have been used as
balls by jugglers, as mentioned in a passage in one of
Seneca’s letters. But the balls of cool glass, mentioned
by other writers, held in their hands by ladies in summer,
must surely have been solid, like the spheres of rock
crystal put to a similar use by the Japanese. The next
step was to give the bulb of glass a ‘kick’ at the base,
and to prolong the neck; we have then the type of the
so-called lachrymatories, perhaps the commonest and
best known form of classical glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >There is in the British Museum an important collection
of blown glass vessels which have been found in
Syrian tombs. The actual <i>provenance</i> is here, as indeed
in the case of so many other finds of glass, very difficult
to ascertain. Some of the pieces are said to come from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
the neighbourhood of Nazareth, but the majority were
probably found nearer to the coast, not far from Sidon and
Tyre. The forms are on the whole classical, but Oriental
influences may be seen in some cases, as in the double
<i>unguentaria</i> which resemble certain Egyptian kohl-pots
(<a href='#p07'>Plate <span class='fss'>VII</span>.</a>). The apparent abundance of this Syrian
glass, and the clear, nearly colourless material, point to a
time rather after than before our era.</p>

<p class='c001' >We know that soon after the middle of the first
century, all the various forms and applications that we
associate with the blown glass of the Romans were in
general use in Italy. The proof of this lies in the vast
collection of ancient glass in the museum at Naples.
There were some years ago in this collection more than
eight thousand pieces of glass, and it is constantly being
added to. By far the greater part of this glass comes
from Pompeii. Now that town was destroyed in the
year 79 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, and it had sixteen years previously suffered
so seriously from an earthquake that little glass can have
survived; we are thus able to fix within exceptionally
narrow limits the date of most of the glass discovered in
the ruins. Apart from a few elaborate examples extracted
from the tombs—some of these may well be of an earlier
date—we find a vast series of vessels adapted to various
domestic purposes, but more especially to uses connected
with the storing and drinking of wine. These are for the
most part made of a transparent and often colourless
blown glass. By this time, then, the art of the glass-blower
must have been fully developed in Southern Italy.
The Pompeian glass has been well preserved by the thick
bed of dry ashes, and has suffered little from surface
decomposition.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c001' >From a few scattered references in Roman writers we
can in a measure trace the rapid change in the position
of glass at Rome, say between the latter days of the
Republic and the end of the reign of Augustus. Cicero
mentions glass as an article of merchandise brought from
Egypt, together with paper and linen. Strabo, writing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
under the rule of Augustus, says that at Rome every day
new processes were invented for colouring glass and for
simplifying its manufacture, so that ‘a successful imitation
of crystal may now be made so cheaply that a
drinking-glass with its stand can be sold for a copper
coin’ (xvi. 25).</p>

<p class='c001' >It is not, however, from Italy, or even from Mediterranean
lands, that the greater part of the Roman glass in
our collections comes, and this is especially the case if
we confine ourselves to the ‘hollow ware’—the true blown
glass with which we are at present concerned. Already
in Pliny’s time the new industry had spread to Spain and
Gaul, where, before long, favoured no doubt by the
cheapness of the fuel and of the raw materials, important
centres of manufacture must have sprung up. We learn
from Strabo that not long before his time the Britons
obtained what little glass they used—this was confined,
indeed, to articles of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i>—from the Continent.
But though we have no direct evidence on this point,
there can be little doubt but that glass-works were established
at least by the second century in the southern
parts of England, and that, to give one example, the large
globular and quadrangular urns of greenish glass were
made at glass-works not far from the tombs in which
they are found.</p>

<p class='c001' >Indeed, the bulk of this northern glass is of a sepulchral
character. The large size and the graceful shapes
of the well-known cinerary urns argue a complete
mastery of the technical processes, and point to works
on an extensive scale where large glass pots must have
been in use. These spherical urns owe their preservation
for the most part to the fact that they were enclosed in
‘coffins’ of lead or stone. The somewhat prosaic and
ungainly square bottles that often replace them must
have been blown into a mould of some kind.</p>

<p class='c001' >Little or no trace of local influence can be found in
the shapes or the material of the glass made in the
second, third, and fourth centuries in Gaul, in Britain,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
or on the Rhine. In the Glass-Room in the British
Museum, the large vessels of blown glass are chiefly of
Gallic origin; the most important come from a collection
made many years ago in the south-east of France. They
may be compared with the Roman glass found in Britain
exhibited in the Central Saloon. On the whole, these
large glass urns are characteristic of the northern and
western provinces. While they appear to be unknown in
Greece and in the East, in the Roman columbaria they
form a very small proportion of the urns ranged in the
niches and along the shelves.</p>

<p class='c001' >The gigantic cinerary urns from Kentish cemeteries
are only rivalled in size by some of the Pompeian glass
at Naples. Among the glass from cemeteries in Southern
Britain in the British Museum are many jugs and bottles
of quaint and original form, and others which for grace
and purity of outline it would be difficult to rival elsewhere
(<a href='#p09'>Plate <span class='fss'>IX</span>.</a>). Notice especially the handles, and above
all the insertion of the lower end of these handles into
the side of the vessel. It is the neglect of attention to
this point that so often gives an impression of weakness
to the handles of modern ware, whether of pottery or of
glass. But here the ribbed handle terminates in spreading
lines that clasp the flank of the jug like the claws of
a bird of prey; I do not know of any happier or simpler
application of the viscous material. At times the central
rib of the handle is prolonged into a wing-like flange
descending nearly to the base of the vase, or may be
ending in a long trail of glass worked by the <i>pucella</i> into
quills or teeth.</p>

<p class='c001' >A greater variety of forms is naturally found in glass
made for domestic use than in specimens destined for
the tomb. It is this variety that gives a special interest
to the collection at Naples. M. Froehner has described
nearly thirty different forms of glass vessels (<cite>Collection
Charvet</cite>, pp. 76-80), and has attempted to apply to each
of them the distinctive classical name, both Greek and
Latin. But many of these terms are rather names of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
Greek fictile ware than of Roman glass, and as to the
remainder, it is rather to the Byzantine scholiasts of later
times than to writers of a good period, where allusions
to glass are rare and vague, that resource has been had.
The richest mines for information of this kind are the
works of Petronius and Athenæus—this last author gives
a list of a hundred varieties of drinking-vessels. But in
both cases it is of vessels of silver or of pottery rather
than of glass that the writer is generally thinking.</p>

<p class='c001' >As a rule, the shapes and methods of decoration of
Roman glass follow a line of their own, dependent on
the ‘habits’ of the material. It is, however, easy to
recognise forms derived from pottery, and even from
bronze, in any large collection of Roman glass. Just as
the so-called Samian ware is imitated in the moulded
glass bowls, so we find that a class of pottery, common
in England, in which the soft clay has been pressed in,
perhaps with the fingers, to form on the sides vertical
trough-like depressions, has been closely imitated in
blown glass—such rounded depressions are easily given
to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paraison</span></i> by means of a blunt piece of wood.
Again, the decoration of white slip, equally common on
Romano-British fictile ware, is imitated by means of
‘trailed stringings’ on glass, if indeed in this case the
imitation is not in some measure the other way—from
glass to pottery.</p>

<p class='c001' >Perhaps the most characteristic decoration of the
earlier transparent glass is given by a series of parallel
ribs. This ‘pillar moulding’ may be formed on the
surface in various ways—by stringings partly melted
on to the surface, or by the use of a mould at one
period in the development of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paraison</span></i>. A graceful
type of these little ribbed or gadrooned bowls—amber
coloured, or again white with blue ribs—has been found
over and over again in pre-Roman tombs on both sides
of the Alps; these bowls are often seen in the museums
of Switzerland and North Italy. Apart from beads and
small objects of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i>, they appear to be the earliest
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span>
articles of glass exported to the Celtic tribes of these
districts, but nothing is known as to their place of
origin. In other cases such ribs or stringings, bending
round the body in a more or less gentle spiral, form a
very happy scheme of ornament.</p>

<p class='c001' >The decoration by trailed stringings—necessarily a
rapid process, by which happy effects are sometimes
attained almost by accident—may be regarded as a
genuinely vitreous process. It is often combined with
fringes and toothings impressed—on the margin of the
handles above all—by the rapid and skilful use of the
pincers. The commonest, and probably the oldest, application
is as a more or less closely coiled stringing round
the neck of the bottle or jug; this is convenient for
handling, and gives the appearance at least of additional
strength. The stringings on the later forms tend to hang
loose upon the surface, sometimes taking the form of
hastily written characters.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c018'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >The cords and threadings may often be of a different
colour from the vessel upon which they are applied—they
may be reduced to knots or mere drops applied here and
there. In such cases we have an apparent approach to
decoration by enamel. But the form of ornament that
we are now dealing with is applied directly to the soft
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paraison</span></i> or to the still unfinished vessel, and the glass
of which the stringings are formed is probably of the
same composition as that on which it is superimposed.</p>

<p class='c001' >So of the splashed or mottled ware. We have here
real splashes of a liquid material applied to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paraison</span></i>
while still on the blowing-tube. When the neck was
subsequently shaped, these circular markings were drawn
out into ellipsoid forms, showing that this part of the
vessel was made at a later period. It is instructive
to compare this result of the work of the blowing-tube
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
with the patterns on the millefiori bowls. In these latter
patterns we find no trace of subsequent distortion—a
proof that the glass of which they form part has never
passed through the stage of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paraison</span></i> or vesicle.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c018'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Enamelling on Glass</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >I now for the first time have to treat of the decoration
of glass by enamel painting. It may be as well here to
explain that in a true enamel, as the term is used in
ceramic and vitreous art, the coloured decoration is
applied to the glassy surface (either glaze or glass body)
in the form of a pigment worked up with water or other
liquid. Such enamel paints are composed, in later times
at least, of a base of silicate of lead (the flux), coloured
by various metallic oxides. It is essential that these
enamels should be more fusible than the body on which
they are painted, so that when subjected to the heat
of the muffle-fire they may be completely fused, while
the glass or glaze on which they rest is not more than
superficially softened. Such enamel decoration, whether
on porcelain or on glass, may vary from a mere wash of
colour on the one hand, of which it is sometimes difficult
to say whether it has ever been subjected to the heat of
the muffle-fire, to a true vitreous covering on the other,
where the various colours stand out in relief like so many
jewels.</p>

<p class='c001' >I may say at once that the Romans, as far as we
know, never attained to any great success in this method
of decoration. Its full development was reserved for the
Saracens of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. This
is indeed the one important advance made in the artistic
manipulation of glass since ‘the palmy days of Rome.’</p>

<p class='c001' >Not but that the Romans, and probably to some
extent the Phœnicians and the Alexandrian Greeks before
them, did not draw and paint upon their glass; but if
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
we may judge from the rare and fragmentary examples
that have survived, they were unable to obtain much
decorative effect by this means; again, the very poverty
and the paint-like quality of such enamels as they used,
have doubtless in many cases led to their total disappearance
from the surface of the glass.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c018'><sup>[36]</sup></a> The painting on the
cup-like lids of the little bowls from Cyprus I have
already mentioned. On a few fragments of thin glass
from Egypt, draped figures have been painted in opaque
colours. Perhaps the nearest approach to an effective use
of enamel colours may be seen on two little cups found in
graves of the fourth century at Varpelev, in Denmark.
These Scandinavian tombs have yielded many interesting
pieces of glass, as well as some bronze vessels—possibly
booty brought home from marauding expeditions. The
designs on these cups (they are illustrated in the <cite>Proceedings
of the Copenhagen Antiquarian Society</cite>, 1861) are
thus described by Mr. Nesbitt: ‘On the larger one are
a lion and a bull, on the lesser two birds with grapes....
The colours are vitrified and slightly in relief—green,
blue, and brown may be distinguished.’ (<cite>Slade Catalogue</cite>,
p. xvi. See also some account of glass from these
and other Scandinavian tombs in Montelius and Reinach,
<cite>Les temps préhistoriques en Suède</cite>.)</p>

<p class='c001' >But the most important and the best preserved example
of enamelling on glass is to be found in a small
bowl, probably of the third or fourth century, preserved
in the treasury of St. Mark at Venice. To this important
collection I shall have more than once to return.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c018'><sup>[37]</sup></a>
The little bowl in question—something over three
inches in height—is of a translucent glass of a winy
or purplish colour. The seven larger medallions that
surround the body are filled with mythological subjects
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
in a fairly good classical style; the pale buff-coloured
figures on a black ground imitate an onyx cameo. Each
medallion is surrounded by a circle of rosettes of brilliant
colours—blue, red, purple, and white. The angular
spaces are filled by smaller medallions, each containing a
head, and the remaining ground is occupied by a tracery
of gold. According to the Canonico Passini, this decoration
is in very slight relief, and is executed in what can
scarcely be regarded as a true vitrified enamel. The
bowl has been mounted at a later time in a light setting
of silver gilt with elegant winged handles. But what is
more curious, at some time previous to the addition of
the mounting, a band of white ornament, resembling
cufic letters, but apparently illegible, has been painted
round the inside just below the rim, and again outside
the base. Much of this later ornament has been abraded,
although the original decoration is well preserved, and
I think that this fact is an argument in favour of the
earlier work being after all of the nature of a true enamel
fixed by fire. I describe this bowl here as I cannot see
any trace of Byzantine influence in the purely classical
medallions.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c018'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Finally, on a few of the gilt catacomb glasses, of which
I shall speak shortly, a little coloured enamel is sparingly
applied here and there, especially in the draperies.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Engraved and Sculptured Glass</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >There remains one large division of Roman glass
which I have purposely left to the last. In this are
comprised the engraved and sculptured pieces, the bulk
of which belong to a late time; indeed we may pass from
work of this kind to glass that is purely Byzantine in
character without any violent transition. But to return
for a moment to examples taken from quite the other end
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
of the series, we have seen that the glass bowls that
are associated with Alexandrian-Greek and early Roman
times are mostly finished by a cutting-tool on some kind
of lathe. In the case of the bowl of white glass from
Canosa in the British Museum, closely imitating in form
the well-known <i>scyphos</i> of the Greek potter, the handles
are apparently carved out of a solid mass (cf. p. <a href='#Page_46'>46</a>); a
very similar bowl in the Charvet collection, said to have
come from Cumæ, is illustrated by Froehner. Still more
interesting is the large shallow bowl or dish of white
glass in our national collection; this is again from a
tomb at Canosa. A ring of some twenty spurs, each
about half an inch in height, arises from the outer
margin; these spurs are carved apparently out of the
solid glass. A large rosette cut in low relief, representing
a full-blown lotus flower, covers nearly the whole
of the surface. With this work we may compare the
rosettes, much more rudely carved, it is true, on the base
of some very similar bowls of late date from the Rhine
country.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of quite a different character is the carving on those
earlier vessels of which we may take the well-known
Portland vase as a type. Here the delicate sculpture in
low relief takes us back to the cameos of the Hellenistic
Greeks, which, as we have seen, were often executed in
a glass paste. But few specimens of work of this kind
have come down to us—some half-dozen in all—and of
these only two are perfect. The body of these vases is
formed by two or more superimposed layers of glass, of
which the outer one, generally of an opaque white, is
ground away by the wheel of the engraver, leaving a
design in low relief upon a basis of blue or other colour.</p>

<p class='c001' >The most famous example of this class is, without
doubt, the Barberini or Portland vase, a two-handled
urn found towards the end of the sixteenth century in
a marble sarcophagus at the Monte del Grano, a lofty
tumulus some three miles to the south-east of Rome.
Whether the tomb from which the urn was extracted was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
that of the Emperor Alexander Severus, who was killed
in the year 225, is not of much consequence, for the vase
itself is certainly of an earlier date. The figures in this
case stand out upon a dark blue ground—we need not
dwell upon the interpretation of the subject. As Wedgwood
long ago pointed out, a rich and almost pictorial
effect is given by cutting down the white layer in places
nearly, but not quite, to the blue base which then shows
through a film of the slightly translucent white paste—an
effect, by the way, that is almost lost in the imitations
of this vase made in the opaque Wedgwood ware. A
curious point about this vase is the fact that the decoration
is continued over the circular base on which it
stands. This medallion-like space is filled by the bust
of a youth with a Phrygian cap wrapped in voluminous
drapery. There is some doubt, however, whether this
medallion is of so early a date as the rest of the vase.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c018'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Almost identical with the Portland vase in technique
and material is the amphora of onyx glass, carved as a
cameo in low relief, which was found in 1837 in a tomb
on the Strada dei Sepolcri at Pompeii. In this case we
have a limit—a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">terminus ad quem</span></i>—for the date, the
middle, that is to say, of the first century of our era.
But the work may well be of a somewhat earlier time
than this. The decoration is distinctly Alexandrian in
character. Notice especially the band at the lower part
with the sheep feeding under trees—in this we are at
once carried back to the pastoral poetry of Sicily. It
will be observed that the vintage scenes with the little
naked ‘putti’ are placed under the handles, while the
place of honour is reserved for the beautiful design of
vine-branches, masks, and birds. The highly developed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
technical skill required, especially in the preliminary blowing
and ‘casing’ of the glass, is, however, an argument
against throwing back too far the date of vases of this
class.</p>

<p class='c001' >Some fragments of another vase of a similar character
were found at Pompeii at a later date; the pieces after
passing through various hands are now in the British
Museum, where they have been united to form (with
extensive gaps) an <i>œnochoë</i> or jug, known as the Auldjo
vase, from the former owner of most of the fragments;
in this case the decoration of the parts preserved consists
chiefly of vine and ivy leaves. There are at Naples many
fragments of onyx glass equal in beauty and skill of
execution to these well-known vases. Among these, the
half of a patera decorated, on a dark blue ground, with a
mask surrounded by the leaves of the Oriental plane, is of
exceptional merit. In other cases the parts in relief seem
to have been cast separately and fixed on to the surface,
a technical process of quite another nature.</p>

<p class='c001' >In all these examples the work of the artist follows
closely on the lines of the carver of cameos—especially of
those cameos where advantage is taken of the parallel
layers of the natural stone, as in the case of the sardonyx
and of the niccolo; it is for this reason that I have
described the material of our Barberini and similar vases
as onyx glass. But there was another and purer variety
of quartz that was coming more and more into favour
during the third and fourth centuries. From this time
onward all through the early Middle Ages, if we are to
judge from the treasures preserved in Christian churches,
to nothing was more value attached than to vases and
cups of rock crystal, often of imposing dimensions, carved
in shallow or deep relief. When once the process of
making a clear colourless glass was mastered, this natural
crystal could be very closely imitated in a material which
was more easily worked. The carvings on the great
majority of the examples of rock crystal that have come
down to us—for example, the vases in the Louvre from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
the Abbey of St. Denis, and those still preserved in the
treasury of St. Mark’s—are of a distinctly Byzantine, if
not rather of a Sassanian or even Saracenic character,
and this style is reflected upon much of the ‘crystal’
glass which is so often confused with the harder stone.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c018'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >The Romans of the fourth century were great masters
of the art of cutting hard stones. Along with a general
decline in taste and artistic invention, there was some
advance in the direction of what we should now call
applied science, and this is exemplified in the nature of
the ‘metal’ and in the method of carving of the later
Roman glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the case of this later engraved glass, the lapidary’s
wheel was applied at times to produce a rough design
by a series of burr-like marks, or again the pattern was
built up of a number of shallow, mostly oval depressions;
in other examples the glass was deeply undercut, so that
the designs appear to float round the vessel, to which
indeed they are only attached by small rods not easily
visible. Of the last kind is the work that may conveniently
be called <i>diatretum</i>, although it is by no means
certain that the <i>diatretarii</i>, mentioned by Ulpian and
others, were necessarily workers in glass, seeing that
carvings of this description, whether in metal, in hard
stones, or in our material, were equally in favour at this
time.</p>

<p class='c001' >We have, unfortunately, no complete example of this
undercut work easily accessible in our public collections.
A fragment, however, in the British Museum throws
much light upon the process of manufacture. On this
piece there remains a portion of the outer frame in the
form of a few letters that have formed part of an inscription;
most of these letters, however, have been broken
away, and we are thus enabled to see the base of the rods
that supported them. The sharp angles of these little
rods, and the marks on the surface of the glass, point
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
unmistakably to the use of a cutting-tool, nor is there, I
think, any trace of soldering at the base of the rods.
We must turn again to the marvellous collection of late
classical and mediæval objects that has been so long preserved
in the treasury of St. Mark’s at Venice for the
most complete specimen of this undercut glass. Here
will be found a <i>situla</i>, or bucket-shaped vessel, of slightly
greenish glass, about eleven inches in height (<a href='#p14'>Plate <span class='fss'>XIV.</span></a>).
On the upper zone is a hunting scene with two horsemen,
treated with a certain energy that calls to mind some of
the Byzantine and even Sassanian work of the fourth
and fifth centuries. Below we have a raised network, or
rather grating—for the motive seems to be taken from a
grille of iron or bronze—formed of four rows, each built
up of fifteen tangential circles bound together at the
points of contact. About half of these circles are more
or less broken, and neither on the ground nor on the
supporting rods thus disclosed was I able on close examination
to discover any of those marks of a cutting-tool
so prominent on the British Museum fragment.
Indeed it is very possible that this late example may be
built up of separately cast pieces soldered on to the base.</p>

<p class='c001' >The famous cup of <i>diatretum</i> glass found near
Strassburg was destroyed during the bombardment of
that city in 1870; it bore an imperfect inscription in
raised letters, which has been interpreted as referring to
the Emperor Maximianus Herculius, the partner of Constantine
in the empire, who put an end to his life in
310. In this case a network of red glass and an inscription
of green glass were superimposed upon a nearly
colourless ground. So in another cup preserved in the
Palazzo Trivulzio at Milan, the inscription <span class='sc'>Bibe Vivas
Multos Annos</span> is again in green glass, but the network
is here blue. Where the detached decoration is of a
different colour from the base, the original vase must
have been of an onyx glass formed by a ‘casing’ process
and of considerable thickness, unless, indeed, we are to
regard the lettering and the network in such cases as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
formed separately and attached to the base by the little
rods. Perhaps the finest example of a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vas diatretum</span></i>
is the bowl found in a stone sarcophagus at Worms,
of which the fragments are now divided between the
museums of Bonn and Mainz. In the former museum
may also be seen a tall amphora-shaped vase (some
twenty inches in height), with Bacchic scenes carved in
low relief, which was found in the same coffin.</p>

<p class='c001' >The oviform bowl belonging to Lord Rothschild is
carved in an olive-green glass, which appears of a deep
red by transmitted light. It is surrounded by five figures
in what is practically complete relief; the subject represented
appears to be the ‘Madness of Lycurgus.’ The
arms and the draperies of these figures are connected to
the base by little rods as in the previous examples, but
to judge from certain cavities in the interior corresponding
to the principal external <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bossages</span></i>, the glass was originally
cast in a mould.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c018'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >The often-quoted expression of Martial, ‘<cite>Surrentinæ
leve toreumata rotæ</cite>,’ written before the end of the first
century, can hardly refer to this undercut work, which
seems to be all of a much later date, nor is it even
certain that the words refer to objects carved in glass
rather than in rock crystal and agate. The word <i>toreumata</i>
is used in connection with silver and even of
earthenware. So the <i>calices</i> and <i>toreumata Nili</i> of
the same writer (xi. 12) seem from the context to be
rather carved in some precious stone. The following
lines, however, are headed ‘Calices Vitrei’:</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
In some other references to glass in Martial’s <cite>Epigrams</cite>
it is mentioned as a cheap material, and contrasted with
gold or rock crystal.</p>

<p class='c001' >As a rule, however, this late Roman glass was cut
in very low relief. The design was often given by the
juxtaposition of a number of ovoid depressions and furrows
scooped in a perfunctory fashion by means of a lapidary’s
wheel of some size.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c018'><sup>[42]</sup></a> At times this wheel was applied so
as to make a rough burr on the surface; on the other hand
but little use was made of the simple engraved line that
we find on the German glass of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p class='c001' >The designs on this later engraved glass are almost
without exception of the most wretched description; any
interest they may have is archæological, and dependent
upon the subject treated. Many pieces, especially in
the form of shallow bowls, have been found in tombs
of the third and fourth centuries in the Rhine district,
especially around Cologne. Some of these bear inscriptions
in often very faulty Greek, but I do not think that
this is a reason for inferring that they are not of local
manufacture.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c018'><sup>[43]</sup></a> On one cup from Cologne the creation of
man by Prometheus is represented, but the majority of
the subjects are of a more or less Bacchanalian or even
of an erotic character. It has been attempted to connect
these with the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabernæ</span></i>, the roadside inns—places of
no good repute in those days—and even to find representations
of these hostelries in certain tall and evidently
secular buildings engraved on them.</p>

<p class='c001' >Still more curious are the spherical ampullæ on which
a panoramic landscape is roughly scratched; in every
case the scene represented is the coast-line from the bay
of Baiæ to Pozzuoli, the names of the various temples and
palaces being indicated by inscriptions. (See Froehner,
p. 96.)</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
Most of this engraved glass dates from a time when
Christianity was widely diffused, but we rarely find on it
subjects connected with the new religion. It would seem
that the associations connected with the glass thus decorated
were not such as would recommend it for Christian
use. The early fathers protested against all such elaborate
and vain arts. ‘The pretentious and useless vainglory
of the engravers on vessels of glass may well cause those
who use them to tremble, and such work should be exterminated
by our good institutions,’—so wrote Clement
of Alexandria early in the third century (quoted by M.
Gerspach, p. 49). There is little to say from the artistic
side for the few specimens of engraved Christian glass
that have come down to us; their aim is purely didactic
and for edification.</p>

<p class='c001' >The wheel was sometimes employed by the Romans
to form a simple pattern by means of a series of polished
ovoid depressions; when these are placed close together,
the effect somewhat resembles that of our modern facetted
glass. The resemblance is still more close when the surface
is cut with a series of intersecting diagonal furrows,
as on the spherical bottle at South Kensington, illustrated
by Mr. Nesbitt in his catalogue.</p>

<p class='c019' >I have now run through the principal varieties of
Roman glass, and the order in which I have arranged
the different classes—the inlaid and millefiori first, then
the moulded, the blown, and finally, the cut and engraved
glass—is in a measure a chronological one, following
roughly the order in which these various methods of
working and styles of decoration succeeded one another,
or rather were dominant, in successive ages. I will end
this chapter with a few notes concerning the methods of
preparation and the geographical distribution of Roman
glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >As far as contemporary evidence goes, all our information
on the first head is derived from the brief and very
unsatisfactory statements of Pliny. There is, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
every reason to believe that there were few important
changes in the construction of the furnaces, or in the preparation
of the materials, during the time that intervened
between, say, the fourth century of our era and the period
in the Middle Ages with regard to which we have further
sources of information. That is to say, we may regard
the comparatively adequate account of the manufacture
of glass given by the monk Theophilus, and by the
pseudo-Heraclius,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c018'><sup>[44]</sup></a> as on the whole applicable to Roman
times. Even at the present day at Murano, and doubtless
at other glass-works little affected by modern industrial
processes, much of the old method of working
and many of the old terms remain almost unchanged.
To give but one example:—when the workman is preparing
the half-liquid gathering or ball of glass at the
end of his blowing-tube, previous to inflating it with his
breath to form the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paraison</span></i> or vesicle, he trundles the
viscous mass upon a slab of iron which rests on the
ground beside his furnace. This iron slab is known
as the ‘marver’—there are similar names for it in other
European languages—and it is always understood that
the plate in question was formerly made of marble. So,
no doubt, it may have been at some remote period, but
we find that the pseudo-Heraclius, describing in the
twelfth century or thereabouts the manufacture of glass,
speaks of this same plate as ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula ferri quæ marmor
vocatur</span></i>.’ Perhaps we should have to go back to the
stone slab on which the Egyptian glass was rolled to find
the origin of this ‘marver.’<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c018'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >We must now see what can be made out of the somewhat
rambling account of the origin and manufacture of
glass given by Pliny at the end of his thirty-sixth book
(cap. 44-47). Pliny regarded glass as a Syrian invention.
For many centuries, he tells us, the sole source of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
principal constituent was a small tract of sand thrown
up by the sea at a spot on the Phœnician coast near the
town of Ptolemais, where the river Belus<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c018'><sup>[46]</sup></a> flows into the
Mediterranean. With this sand the natives mixed the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nitrum</span></i>, imported oversea in cakes,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c018'><sup>[47]</sup></a> and thereby for the
first time formed glass. According to Pliny, these
Phœnicians were astute and ingenious craftsmen, and
they, in time, took to adding to their glass-pots the
‘<i>magnes lapis</i>, which, it is asserted, draws to it the melted
glass like iron.’ This is a statement most characteristic
of Pliny. The <i>magnes lapis</i>—magnetic iron-ore or loadstone—is
the last substance in the world any one would
think of adding to glass. But we know that the ancients
knew of two kinds of black stone, for one of which they
used the masculine form <i>magnes</i>—this was the loadstone—for
the other the female form <i>magnesia</i>;<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c018'><sup>[48]</sup></a> and this
<i>magnesia</i>, at any rate at a somewhat later period, can be
undoubtedly identified with the black oxide of manganese
(<i>MnO<sub>2</sub></i>), a substance known of old as the ‘soap of glass,’
from its power of removing the green colour derived from
iron. Now we have seen that pure white glass, ‘cleansed’
probably by this method, had only comparatively lately
been introduced into Italy, and some confused account
of the new discovery had probably reached Pliny’s ears.
‘In the same way,’ he continues, ‘they took to adding
to the fused mass shining pebbles, then shells and
sandy concretions (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fossiles arenæ</span></i>).’ In these ‘fossils’
we may, perhaps, recognise the source from which was
obtained the lime, an essential constituent of glass.
Passing over some obscure references to the nitre of
Ophir and the copper of Cyprus, Pliny goes on to say
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
that the whole is melted ‘like bronze,’ in closely grouped
furnaces, and that a blackish mass of fatty aspect is obtained.
This we must regard as a preliminary frit, for we
are told that the mass is melted again in the glass-house,
where the requisite colouring matter is added to it. ‘So
the work was carried on of old in the famous glass-works
of Sidon.... At times the glass was shaped by blowing,
or again it was abraded by the wheel, or carved in the
manner of silver.... Such was the ancient way of
making glass. At the present day in Italy also, by the
mouth of the river Vulturnus, for a space of six miles
between Cumæ and Liternum, a white and most soft
sand is collected, which is pounded both in mortar and
mill; it is then mixed with three parts of nitrum,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c018'><sup>[49]</sup></a> by
weight or by measure, and after melting is transferred to
other furnaces. In these the substance, now known as
<i>ammonitrum</i>, is melted and then cast into cakes. These
cakes are again fused to obtain pure glass and cakes of
white glass.’</p>

<p class='c001' >Pliny, in this confused account, where we have apparently
materials from different sources imperfectly welded
together, appears to contrast an older method of manufacture,
practised formerly at Sidon, whose glass-works
he seems to refer to as things of the past, with the newer
processes now in use in Italy. It will be noted that in
both cases a preliminary frit was prepared, although the
term <i>ammonitrum</i>, a word of Greek origin, is applied to
this frit in the latter case only.</p>

<p class='c001' >‘Already,’ says Pliny, ‘the new art of melting sand
with soda (literally “of tempering sand”) has spread
through Gaul and Spain.’ He then goes on to tell, but
with an expression of incredulity quite unusual with him,
the story of the discovery of a malleable glass. According
to this tale (in its earliest form), Tiberius ordered the
workshop of the man who so tempered glass that it became
flexible, to be pulled down, lest the value of bronze,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
silver, and gold should be depreciated. This story was
the delight of the renaissance writers on glass. With
regard to the more amplified and tragic version usually
quoted from Petronius, we must remember that the
remarks put by that writer into the mouth of Trimalchio
are not always to be taken seriously. In later days a
similar tale was told of a French inventor—in this
Richelieu takes the place of Tiberius. After mentioning
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">calices pteroti</span></i>, the costly ‘winged cups’ of Nero,
Pliny gives some account (quite out of its proper place,
by the way) of obsidian, a black stone much resembling
glass, which was shaped not only into various dishes for
use at the table, but also into figures of some size—statues
of the divine Augustus, for instance, for that
monarch much prized the material. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vitrum hæmatinum</span></i>,
‘a red opaque glass,’ is passed over rapidly. ‘White
glass is made also, and murrhine and glass resembling
the hyacinth and the sapphire and glass of all other
colours.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c018'><sup>[50]</sup></a> There is no substance easier to work or to
which brighter colours can be given. The highest place
must, however, be accorded to the white transparent glass
which much resembles crystal; for drinking, it has driven
out vessels of gold and silver.’ This passage is of the
greatest importance. We see that a pure white glass was
still, even in Pliny’s time, something noticeable. This
was, as we shall see, again the case at the time of the
Renaissance, when it was the aim of the glass-makers,
all over Western Europe, to imitate the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vetro di cristallo</span></i>
of the Venetians.</p>

<p class='c001' >It will be noticed that Pliny makes no mention of the
method of preparation of the alkali used in making glass
(in ‘tempering the sand,’ as he puts it). From the context
it would seem that the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nitrum</span></i> was always of the same
nature as that brought by the mariners to the Phœnician
coast—this is, however, very unlikely. Nor have we any
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
information about the arrangement of the furnaces. These
glass houses were, however, well known to the beggars
and loungers of the time—we hear of them as places of
resort in cold weather for those who had no other way of
warming themselves. In the Greek Anthology (No. 323),
of all places in the world, there is a fragment by one
Mesomedes, a contemporary and favourite of Hadrian,
giving an account of a visit to a glass-house. Just at the
point where the little poem breaks off, the workman is
described as placing the molten mass between the blades
of the pincers or shears.</p>

<p class='c001' >Strabo tells us that when he was at Alexandria—he
was there, we know, in the early part of the reign of
Augustus (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</span></i> 24 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>)—he was assured by the glass-workers
(ὑαλουργοί)
that their ‘many-coloured and sumptuous
glass’ could not be made without the addition of
a certain glassy earth which was only found in Egypt,
a story which points to the jealousy of foreign competition
on the part of these craftsmen. So on the Phœnician
coast he hears from some of the wonderful qualities of
the Sidonian sand, while others tell him that one sand
is as good as another. Strabo goes on to speak of the
improvements made ‘quite lately’ in the clear crystal
glass of which the manufacture had not long since been
established at Rome. Compare with this the account of
Pliny; in view of his certainly rather vague statements,
we should hardly have looked for this <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> in Italy at
so early a date.</p>

<p class='c001' >But it is neither from Italy nor from the countries
bordering the Eastern Mediterranean that the most important
supply of Roman glass has been obtained.
Putting aside objects of quite local <i>provenance</i>, it will
be found that in the museums of England, France, and
Germany, by far the larger part of the glass exhibited—and
this is above all the case with the blown glass—has
been found within the limits of the ancient Gallia.
Spain, contrary to what we might have expected, has
yielded little Roman glass of any artistic merit, partly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
perhaps for want of systematic search. But there are
few districts in France or in the west of Germany where
the exploration of Roman cemeteries has not yielded a
plentiful crop. If we travel northward from the estuary
of the Rhone by way of Arles and Nismes to Avignon,
Valence, and Lyons, then across by the country on
either side of the Jura to the valley of the Rhine, and
follow that river by Strassburg to Cologne, we pass for
the whole way through a district especially rich in Roman
glass. And this is what might well be looked for. The
third and fourth centuries—a little earlier or a little later,
according to locality—are above all the great centuries for
the prevalent use of glass, and it was during this period
that the central tract of country that included the two
great metropolitan cities of Arles and Trèves began to
take the prominent place that it maintained throughout
the early Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='c001' >Even our English glass of this time, so much of
which comes from districts to the north and the south of
the estuary of the Thames, may be brought commercially
at least into connection with the wealthy provinces of
Northern and Eastern Gaul. It was from these provinces
that glass was first imported, and from them, no doubt,
the glass-workers passed over to Britain.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the case of the rich collection of Roman glass in
the British Museum, the backbone, as it were, is formed
by the specimens excavated from tombs in the neighbourhood
of the lower Rhone valley—from Vaison, near
Vaucluse (the Comarmond collection), from Apt, and
from Alais. At Arles, in that district of tombs, the
Aliscamps, which furnished Dante with a well-known
image, beneath the Christian sarcophagi (in these, too,
not a little glass has been found), the earlier Roman
tombs lie on the bed-rock. From these tombs numberless
urns of glass, in cases of lead or stone, have been
taken, as well as many examples of glass of rare and
exceptional shapes—among others what is apparently an
alembic for use in distillation. Some of these vessels
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span>
contain a red liquid which may <em>represent</em> at least the
wine with which they were originally filled (Froehner,
p. 109). In this town of Arles, too, in the suburb of
Trinquetailles, there were probably extensive glass-works,
as we may infer from the quantity of vitrified paste there
found (Quicherat, <cite>Revue Archéologique</cite>, xxviii.).</p>

<p class='c001' >To pass to the Roman cemeteries of Lyons: in the
museum of that town are some curious masses of blue
frit taken lately from a tomb on the Fourvière, which call
to mind the fritted cobalt or smalt exported in modern
times from the Saxon mines. We have in the British
Museum many pieces of glass from older explorations at
the adjacent suburb of St. Irénée. There is in the Lyons
Museum a sepulchral stele of much interest found in this
very district; it is to the memory of a certain Julius
Alexander, a citizen of Carthage, a craftsman in the art
of glass (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">opifici artis vitreæ</span></i>). This Punic glass-blower
left behind him children and grandchildren, who doubtless
followed his trade. We must not infer too much from a
single instance; we know, however, from other sources,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c018'><sup>[51]</sup></a>
that there was a large influx into Gaul at this time of
Semitic people, chiefly of a humble status, craftsmen and
small merchants, and that they found their way in above
all by the valley of the Rhone. These ubiquitous traders
are generally referred to as Syrians, and I think it likely
that the glass trade, not only in the south of Gaul but
further afield, may have been in great measure in the
hands of Orientals of this class. This would be especially
true of the manufacture and hawking about of small
objects of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i>,<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c018'><sup>[52]</sup></a> and again of glass pastes containing
lead. But perhaps also the preparation of the more
ambitious and artistic kinds of glass was in the same
hands, leaving only the common ware to the native
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
workmen; in that case the distinction so important in
later days between the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> and the ‘forest-glass’
may have had its prototype in Roman times. It should
be borne in mind that these Semitic craftsmen would for
the most part speak Greek rather than Latin, an important
point that I have not space to develop here.</p>

<p class='c001' >As we pass to Northern Gaul we find examples of
a glass of a pronounced greenish tint more and more
predominating—bulky urns, square and spherical, and
jugs with ‘claw’ handles. All of these forms we are
familiar with in England. The museums of Amiens
and Boulogne are especially rich in this glass, and in
Paris the local finds are well represented in the Musée
Carnavalet.</p>

<p class='c001' >On the other hand, in the glass of the Rhine district,
including of course the Moselle, we have a return to the
more varied types that we met with in the south. Trèves
was the northern rival of Arles; it formed the centre of a
rich district, including Lorraine on the one hand and the
Rhine provinces on the other, where the manufacture of
glass by the third century became an important industry.
And this district has for us a special interest, for here
more than anywhere else we have some evidence to show
that the industry was carried on without interruption
throughout the Middle Ages. The museums of Trèves,
of Cologne and of Bonn, are above all rich in Roman
glass, and the German archæologists have endeavoured—and
this has hardly been attempted elsewhere—to arrange
this glass in a chronological sequence. They think
that they can distinguish the following stages in the
industry:—1. Up to 50 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> glass was a rarity in the
north, but the millefiori and marbled glass of the south
was imported to some extent. 2. After the middle of the
first century, glass-works were established for the manufacture
of large urns and smaller vessels of a ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Natur-glas</span></i>,’
bluish rather than greenish in tint. 3. In the time of
Hadrian (117-130 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) a pure white glass was introduced;

bluish glass. 4. The period of the greatest development
was about 200 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> Many kinds of decoration were in
fashion, as zig-zag threadings on coloured glass. 5. After
250 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> This was the time of the glass with the <i>Frontinus</i>
stamp.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c018'><sup>[53]</sup></a> The prevailing tint is a strong green,
no longer bluish; the decoration is given chiefly by
engraving and cutting; Christian subjects begin to
appear. To this period also belongs glass decorated with
coloured medallions of glass paste.</p>

<p class='c001' >I give this scheme of classification under all reserve;
the interlarding of a period of white glass between two
stages of ‘green glass’ may perhaps be open to criticism,
but at all events it is a step in the right direction. It
must be borne in mind that this Rhenish glass belongs to
the same Romano-Celtic family as that found in France,
but, as in the latter country, the Celtic element is scarcely
perceptible. The art was an entirely new one, and there
was no earlier tradition to influence the work as in the
case of the contemporary pottery, armour, or sculpture.</p>

<p class='c001' >It so happens that the Roman glass of Gaul has been
most carefully studied in a district far away from the
route that we have been following. In Western France
the researches of M. Benjamin Fillon (<cite>L’Art de la terre
chez les Poitevins</cite>, 1864, and other works) have brought
to light the remains of old glass-works. These appear to
have been generally situated far from the main centres,
and they were often associated with potteries. It would
even seem that glass was at one time more in favour and
perhaps cheaper than earthenware. A curious point is
the number of localities in Poitou and La Vendée which
bear names such as La Verrerie and Verrière; at as
many as seven places with names of this class, M. Fillon
claims to have found the remains of Gallo-Roman glass-works.
These do not appear to have been established
before the time of Trajan, and it is to the age of the
Antonines in the second century that the more important
examples of glass are to be attributed. Of somewhat
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
later date than this, however, are the fifty pieces of white
glass from the villa and tomb of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme-artiste</span></i> at St.
Médard-des-Prés. This was M. Fillon’s most important
find; some of the vases contained various coloured
substances and resins, and they were closed by stoppers of
wood or by sheaths of bronze.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c018'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >The British Museum has lately acquired a large
collection of Gallo-Roman glass formed by M. Moret.
Among this glass—it comes chiefly from late Gallic
cemeteries in the neighbourhood of Paris, as from Corbeil
and Conflans (Confluentia), and also from the Rheims
district—may be seen beakers with circular feet and wide-mouthed
cups with rounded bases.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c018'><sup>[55]</sup></a> To one of these a
fantastic decoration has been given by a contorted streak
of blood-like tint in the midst of the glass—caused by
the perhaps accidental presence of a fragment of copper-oxide;
we have here at any rate one of the earliest
instances of the use of this valuable pigment to obtain a
transparent red. Notice, too, the large receptacle cast in
the form of a fish; similar vessels have been found at
Arles, and they have been brought into connection with
the well-known Christian symbol of the
ἰχθύς.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Roman Glass in Britain</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >There does not seem to be any example of a vessel of
glass from a pre-Roman tomb in Britain. The little
ribbed bowls that have been found in Celtic tombs further
south did not apparently reach our country. The
ὕαλα σκεύη
and the
λυγκούρια
mentioned by Strabo in an involved
passage as among the imports into Britain, we
must interpret as <em>beads</em> of glass and amber. From that
time until the eighth century, when the Venerable Bede
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
wrote his history, we have not a word of documentary
evidence bearing upon the question of glass in our
country. Nor have we any definite evidence, apart from
a few lumps of glass that may have had their origin in an
accidental fire, that any glass-works existed in England
during this long interval,—no evidence, that is to say,
apart from that based upon the large amount of Roman
glass found in England and the size of many of the specimens.
The English glass, however, in no way differs from
that taken from Roman tombs in the north of France.
I have mentioned already the most noticeable types—the
large urns, both spherical and quadrangular, the graceful
jugs and vases with ribbed handles, and the little bowls
of thin moulded glass with scenes taken from the circus.
It is perhaps remarkable that the art of the enameller on
metal, which we know at this time had been brought to a
great perfection in Britain,<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c018'><sup>[56]</sup></a> appears in no way to have
influenced the glass-blower, and it would seem that in
Britain glass vessels have been rarely found together with
specimens of champlevé enamel.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c018'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Most of the finer examples of native Roman glass in
our museums have been excavated from cemeteries adjacent
to the lower Thames valley, around Colchester and
other stations to the north, but above all on the southern
bank, in the district lying between the mouth of the Medway
and the Isle of Thanet. In this neighbourhood, in
the flat land between Sittingbourne and Faversham, were
situated what were probably the most extensive potteries
of Britain, and it is hereabouts if anywhere in England
that we might look for traces of glass-works of Roman
date. As we go further west and further north, glass,
large examples at any rate, becomes comparatively rare,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
and this is true even of the neighbourhood of such
important stations as York and Cirencester.</p>

<p class='c019' >In the case of the glass of the ancients, the material is
so vast, so varied, and spread over so wide an area, that a
concentrated treatment of the subject, as this must needs
be, is rendered very difficult. Much that is both interesting
and important must be omitted or only briefly alluded
to; and this must be my excuse for making little more
than a passing mention of the inscriptions found at times
on this glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >These inscriptions fall into two classes:—1. A propitiatory
sentence or expression of well-wishing addressed,
it would seem, to the person to whom the piece is presented;
of such we have already given some examples.
2. The name of the maker. With few exceptions these
inscriptions are confined to glass that has been blown
into a mould, and this for practical reasons which will be
obvious.</p>

<p class='c001' >The signature of Ennion may be read in many cases
on little vases or bottles found in Italy, in Cyprus, and
in the Crimea. Ennion worked probably at Sidon or at
Tyre and quite possibly as far back as the third century
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> The words
ΜΝΗϹΘΗ Ο ΑΓΟΡΑΖΩΝ
‘Let the buyer remember,’
which he sometimes added to his name, were perhaps
intended to accentuate the signature. The glass-blowers
of Sidon seem to have been proud of their native town;
along with their signature its name generally appears on
the ‘thumb-piece’ of the handle: that of Irenæus is in
each case accompanied by the head of an emperor in relief—Augustus
or perhaps Caligula. Artas, whose signature
has been found more often than any other, gives his name
both in Latin and
Greek—<span class='fss'>ARTAS SIDON</span>—<span class='fss'>ΑΡΤΑϹ ϹΕΙΔΩ</span>.</p>

<p class='c001' >Let us now pass to examples of a later date that are
characteristically and distinctly Roman. What can be
more so than the large quadrangular bottles, on the base
of which so many inscriptions have been found? Here,
as on the contemporary pottery, the reference is generally
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
to the owner of the works whose name is accompanied
sometimes by the word <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">patrimonium</span></i>. But the inscription
is often reduced to four letters placed in the angles—letters
that have been a standing puzzle to antiquaries.
Many pieces of glass bearing the stamp of Firmus, of
Hilarus, or again of Hylas—contracted or in the genitive
case—have been found not only in Italy (as in the neighbourhood
of Perugia), but also in the Cologne district.
On the other hand, the signature of Frontinus is above
all frequent on a series of barrel-shaped glass vessels of
a late date, which come from various places in the north
of France, more especially from Picardy; but the signature
is found in the Rhine country also. The firm seems
to have been as important and its outturn as widespread
as that of the Bonhomme family of Liége in the seventeenth
century. Several examples of the Frontinus
signature in various forms are given by M. Froehner.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c018'><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >It is a curious fact that in no case, as far as I am
aware, has the custom of the manufacturer adding his
name to the glass made by him become general in later
times. The practical difficulties in the case of blown
glass may be a sufficient reason for this. Perhaps the
most important exception may be found in the stamps
of makers’ names on wine-bottles of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p class='c001' >Let me in one final word accentuate what seems to
me the commanding point of interest in this rich and
varied series—the glass of the Romans. We have in it
the one branch of Roman art that was not dominated
by Greek influence and traditions; it was an art which,
although essentially developed under the Roman rule,
had its origin in Semitic lands. As an industry I
cannot help thinking that it spread along with that
interpenetration of Hellenised Syrians that played so
important a part in the propagation of Christianity and
other Oriental cults through the west of Europe.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />EARLY CHRISTIAN GLASS, BYZANTINE GLASS, AND THE GLASS OF THE MIDDLE<br />AGES IN THE EAST AND THE WEST.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_7 c006'     >The vague and indefinite use of the terms ‘Byzantine
Period’ and ‘Byzantine Art’ has been the
cause of much confusion in many branches of
history, and nowhere more than in the history of architecture.
Were I treating of the latter art I should prefer
to use the term in its narrower sense, confining it within
definite limits of time and space. With the minor arts,
however—illuminated manuscripts, ivories, and metal
ware—the case is different. Here the term Byzantine
may often be conveniently applied to cover a very wide
field; so in the case of glass, the rare specimens that
come to us from widely scattered sources find, for a long
period, a common centre, as it were, in Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c001' >After the end of the third century the East begins
once more to assert itself. The spread of the Christian
religion, the transference of the capital of the empire to
Constantinople, and again the advance of the barbaric
tribes, were all important factors in this movement. As
far as our northern lands are concerned, the importance
of this last factor as an orientalising influence has perhaps
not been sufficiently recognised. We think of this
advance chiefly as a descent of Germanic tribes from the
north upon Italy. But this last movement was only a
side issue—the general progress was from East to West.
We know now that for whatever culture these tribes
brought with them at the time of their advance, they were
at least as much indebted to the early civilisations of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>90</a></span>
Western Asia as to that of Greece and Rome. It was
only with the fringe of this latter civilisation, and that
comparatively lately, that they had come into contact.
In a measure we may look upon the influence of what we
call classical civilisation as merely a temporary interruption,
a breaking in upon the old established route by
which the peoples, and still more the produce, of the East
reached Western Europe. This is what gives that
Oriental <i>nuance</i>, often so difficult to define, to so much
of our Western European art of the early Middle Ages,<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c018'><sup>[59]</sup></a>
up to the time when the Roman culture, under the lead
of the Western Church, asserted itself once more.</p>

<p class='c001' >So in the somewhat miscellaneous assortment of glass
from many lands, and often of uncertain date, that we
treat of in this chapter, it is this new wave of Oriental
influence working upon the now decadent Roman types
which gives in some measure a common note to objects
otherwise so divergent.</p>

<p class='c001' >In another way the spread of the new religion had an
even more direct and practical bearing on our subject-matter.
If between the fourth and thirteenth century—between
the later Gallo-Roman glass and the enamelled
glass of the Saracens—there is in our collections a gap
representing nearly a thousand years, only sparingly filled
up by a few rare examples, the immediate cause is to be
found in the abandonment of the practice of cremation,
and of the habit of burying objects of value with the
deceased. Fortunately for us, however, there was at first
one important exception to this rule, and to this exception
we owe the survival of so many specimens of a family
of glass which is essentially both Christian and Roman, a
family which should therefore rightly find its place at the
commencement of the present chapter.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>GILT GLASS OF THE CEMETERIES<br />
1. FROM COLOGNE. 2 AND 3. FROM ROME</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c001' >The <span class='sc'>Gilt Glass of the Cemeteries</span> is, indeed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
strictly Roman, both in <i>provenance</i> and in its artistic and
technical relationships. The essential character of this
early Christian glass depends upon the inclusion of a foil
of thin gold between two plates of glass united by fusion.
This is the principle of the decoration of the two bowls
from Canosa that I have already described, and, indeed,
in the technical difficulties overcome, and still more in
artistic merit, these bowls far excel any later work of this
class. As it is, the interest of these <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetri a fondi d’oro</span></i>,
as the Italians call them, depends rather upon the fact
that they constitute one of the earliest records of the art
of the primitive Church, than upon any especial merit
they may possess as examples of glass.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c018'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >It is now well known that nearly all these little discs
of glass have formed the base of tazza-shaped bowls, or
of cups of conical form. Most of them have been extracted
from the plaster in which they were embedded at
the sides of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">loculi</span></i>, where in the passages of the catacombs
the corpses were deposited. There is also a class
of smaller medallions or studs, covered with thick lenticular
glass, which were inserted round the body of a
glass cup; in a few rare examples, chiefly from Cologne,
the medallions remain in their original position on the
cup (<a href='#p10'>Pl. <span class='fss'>X.</span></a>). These studs are sometimes of blue glass,
and we are then reminded of a style of decoration in use
in earlier times—blue bosses or ribs, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appliqués</span></i> or fused
into the body of the bowl.</p>

<p class='c001' >Apart from a few remarkable specimens found beneath
some of the old churches of Cologne, as at St. Ursula
and St. Severinus, these gilt glasses come almost exclusively
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
from the catacombs of Rome. The Roman
collections naturally contain the most numerous specimens;
in the British Museum, however, may be seen an
important and typical series, illustrating most of the
points of interest.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the preparation of these <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetri a fondi d’oro</span></i>, the
gold leaf was laid down upon the glass with some gum
or varnish; the superfluous gold was then scraped away,
and the internal lines of the draperies accentuated with a
sharp metallic point; a covering of glass was then superimposed.
So far all are agreed; but as to the actual
process by which the two sheets of glass were united,
there is some difference of opinion. The problem had
already appealed to Heraclius, the writer of some barbarous
hexameters treating <cite>De Coloribus et Artibus
Romanorum</cite>. Heraclius was probably a monk living at
Rome, perhaps about the end of the tenth century.
The fifth of his little didactic poems is inscribed ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De
fialis auro decoratis</span></i>.’ In this he tells us how he produced
some small cups of pure glass, smeared them with
gum with a brush, and then proceeded to lay down on
them leaves of gold. On the gold leaf, when dry, he
inscribed birds, men, lions, as it pleased his fancy.
‘Finally,’ says Heraclius, ‘I fitted over the surface, glass
rendered thin by a skilful blast of the fire; but when the
glass had yielded equally to the heat, it united itself
admirably to the phials as a thin sheet.’<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c018'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Theophilus, writing a few generations later, probably
in Germany, knew nothing of this cemetery glass.
He describes, however, the process by which the Byzantine
Greeks made their gold mosaics by sprinkling a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>93</a></span>
layer of powdered glass over the gold leaf covering the
surface of the tesseræ; this coating was then fused on.
But this was an enameller’s process, and the coating
must have consisted of a somewhat fusible glass, perhaps
containing lead. The Greeks employed, he tells us, a
similar process in decorating their glass cups.</p>

<p class='c001' >Signor Andrea Rioda, the art director of the <i>Impresa
Venezia-Murano</i>, tells me that in the case of some clever
imitations of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">fondi d’oro</span></i> made by his firm, the gold
leaf was fixed upon a thickish sheet of glass, a thinner
sheet was then placed over it, and the whole heated to
the softening-point. A third method has been adopted
in the preparation of some experimental imitations made
by Mr. Westlake: that gentleman soldered together the
two sheets of glass round the edges only, by means of a
flux.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the general treatment of the figure, and in the
choice of the subject, we are reminded in the case of this
cemetery glass of the reliefs upon contemporary Christian
sarcophagi—that is to say of the more rudely executed of
these reliefs. But among these <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">fondi d’oro</span></i> there is a
small class of portrait heads, highly finished by means of
a sort of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pointillé</span></i> or stipple process, which are of a somewhat
superior artistic merit. In these circular medallions—miniatures,
we might call them<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c018'><sup>[62]</sup></a>—the large eyes, the
small mouth, and a peculiar affable but sad and ‘worn-out’
expression, remind us of the portrait heads on late
mummy cases brought from the Fayum. These highly
finished miniatures are probably of somewhat earlier
date than the typical glass from the catacombs.</p>

<p class='c001' >We find occasionally in this cemetery glass a sparing
use of coloured enamels, above all on the draperies.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c018'><sup>[63]</sup></a> In
others the outlines, it would seem, were cut into the glass
and filled up with coloured pastes, a process of great
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
technical interest; I have not, however, myself seen an
example of such work.</p>

<p class='c001' >A few rare pieces with Jewish symbols have been
found, but not in any case, I think, from Jewish cemeteries.
We see the scrolls of the law lying on the <i>aron</i>, and the
seven-branched candlestick. I have already pointed out
that at this time in Rome the working of glass was very
probably to some extent in the hands of Jews and
Judaising Christians.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c018'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >The cemetery glass dates, it would seem, from the
fourth and from the first half of the fifth century, but
some of the finer pieces may be a little older. The
disasters of the fifth century and the rapid decline of
Rome after the time of Honorius help to explain the
total extinction of this <i>genre</i> soon after the latter period.</p>

<p class='c001' >Apart from these gilt medallions, the examples of
glass that may be classed as early Christian present no
special feature. There is in the British Museum a series
of cameo medallions, some of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">hæmatinum</span></i> and others of
sapphire-blue glass paste. In these the treatment of the
figures—the Virgin and Child and St. George (or possibly
St. Theodore) are the favourite subjects—is quite Byzantine
in character. In the Vatican Museum, among many
other such medallions, are some cast from the same
moulds as our English examples. The little <i>pendeloques</i>
of stamped glass remind one of the late Roman and
Saracenic glass weights found in Egypt; they have formed
probably parts of a necklace, or they may have been
attached to drapery.</p>

<p class='c001' >The early Christian engraved glass is of more importance,
but it in no way differs in technique from that
carved with pagan subjects; some of the vases may
possibly have served as chalices for use in the service of
the Eucharist. In the British Museum is a conical cup
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
from Cologne; the figures are roughly cut with the
wheel, and the subjects from the Old and New Testaments
are the same as those found on contemporary
sarcophagi. The design on the Podgoriza bowl,<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c018'><sup>[65]</sup></a> perhaps
the finest example of early Christian engraving on glass,
shows the influence of the northern barbarians; there is
a Viking air about some of the subjects. Notice especially
the ship from which Jonah is being thrown, and the
gaping monsters in the sea, more like dragons than
whales. (See Mr. Arthur Evans’s paper in <cite>Archæologia</cite>,
vol. xlviii.)</p>

<p class='c019' >As I have already said, the gap which exists between
the later Roman and the great school of enamelled Saracenic
glass of the thirteenth century can only be filled by
a few scattered examples from widely distant sources.
The tombs now fail us, and we are thrown back for the
most part upon the treasures and relics preserved in the
churches of Italy, France, and Germany. Such objects
represent but one aspect of the glass produced at the
time: they reflect above all the skill now acquired in
staining glass so as to imitate precious stones. We shall
see later that there has been preserved an interesting
literary record bearing especially on such imitations.
The alchemists now begin to come into touch with the
glass-workers—a connection that has been maintained
even to quite recent times. The Jews, too, were early
occupied with the manufacture of coloured pastes, and
their interest in the subject has continued, as we know,
up to the present day.</p>

<p class='c001' >It would be impossible to neglect the importance of
Constantinople when treating of the art of the early
mediæval—the so-called dark ages. But so far as glass,
in our narrower sense of the word, is concerned, there is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
little that can be definitely attributed to that city. For
us, however, the interest of the Greek Empire lies in the
fact that we have in it a common middle term with which
to correlate the art of the Copts in Egypt, of the Sassanians
in Persia, and at a later time, in some measure,
that of the early Saracen dynasties and even of the
Anglo-Saxons and the Franks in the north. At two
widely separated periods the influence of Constantinople
has been more directly felt. The first centres round
Justinian in the sixth century; we are brought at that
time into relation with the Copts and the Sassanian
rulers of Persia. The other is the time of the great
revival of Byzantine power in the tenth century, when,
chiefly through alliances with the emperors of the Saxon
house, the renewed art of the Greeks spread through
Germany and even reached, not for the first time indeed,
the shores of England.</p>

<p class='c001' >The great work, no doubt, of the Byzantines in the
domain of glass is to be found in the manufacture of the
mosaics with which they lined the walls of their churches,
and when we hear that glass was made at Thessalonica,
and again that one of the gates of the capital was named
after the adjacent glass-works, it is of this branch of the
art that we must first think.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c018'><sup>[66]</sup></a> Byzantine artists travelled
to Cordova on the one hand, and to Damascus on the
other, to work in mosaic for Mohammedan masters; we
find them, too, at Rome, at Ravenna, and at Aachen.
No doubt these <i>musivi</i> took with them, at first at least,
the materials with which they built up their pictures.</p>

<p class='c001' >For the use of coloured glass in the windows of
churches, we may probably find a similar origin. In
Justinian’s great church glass was not used for mosaics
only; there were windows filled with stained glass, some
of which may even now be in place. In the seventh
century we hear of Greek workmen summoned to France
for such work, just as from Merovingian France, as Bede
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span>
tells us, Benedict Biscop obtained, a little later, skilled
craftsmen to make the glass for his new church at Monk
Wearmouth.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the ode that Paul the Silentiary wrote for the
opening ceremony at St. Sophia (563 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>), he speaks of
silver discs, hanging from chains and pierced to receive
vessels of ‘fire-wrought’ glass, shaped like the butt of a
spear
(οὐρίαχος)
(Lethaby’s <cite>Santa Sophia</cite>, p. 50 <i>seq.</i>).<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c018'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >We have here in these lamps what is probably the
first mention of a new use for our material—one which
became before long, for a time, the dominant one. In the
‘spear-butt’ shaped lamps of St. Sophia we may see the
prototypes of the conical oil-cups of the Saracens.</p>

<p class='c001' >Glass, however, was never held in great honour in
the ceremonies of the Christian Church. Chalices and
patens of glass are indeed mentioned in the <cite>Liber Pontificalis</cite>
as in use at the end of the second century: St.
Jerome writes of ‘the Lord’s blood being borne in a
vessel of glass,’ and some early miracles have reference
to the making good of glass that had been broken. Of
a ninth-century saint we are told that his Eucharistic
vessels were first of wood, then of glass, and finally of
pewter! In later times the use of so fragile a material
fell out of use, and was even forbidden by the Church.</p>

<p class='c001' >In shape it would seem that these early chalices
resembled the Greek <i>cantharus</i>. Of this form is what
is perhaps the oldest example of a metal chalice that
has survived—the cup found at Gourdon, now in the
Bibliothèque Nationale. We have, or rather had, another
example of this type in the golden chalice inlaid with
jewels which was formerly preserved at Monza. In fact,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
this form is especially characteristic of early Byzantine
art; we see such vases represented over and over again
on marble reliefs and mosaics. Now in the British
Museum there are two vases, distinctly of this <i>cantharus</i>
shape; they are of blue, somewhat bubbly glass, with
fluted body: one which is perfect was found at Amiens
(<a href='#p12'>Plate <span class='fss'>XII.</span></a>); the other, from the Slade collection, has
lost its handles. These vases may well date from the
sixth century, and they may very probably have served
as chalices.</p>

<p class='c001' >Let us now turn to some of the rare specimens of
early glass to be found in the treasuries of churches,
chiefly in the north of Italy.</p>

<p class='c001' >At Rome, in the church of St. Anastasia, is a bowl
of opaque glass, with ornaments in relief, mounted on
a metal foot. This claims to be the chalice used by
St. Jerome.</p>

<p class='c001' >More famous is the <i>sacro catino</i> preserved in the
cathedral of St. Lorenzo at Genoa. There is no reason
to doubt the story that this bowl fell to the share of a
Genoese when the town of Cæsarea was sacked by the
Crusaders in the year 1101. It seems to have suffered
no diminution in sanctity from a want of uniformity in
the tradition as to its earlier history.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c018'><sup>[68]</sup></a> The <i>sacro catino</i>
is a shallow hexagonal bowl with feet and handles; the
slight ornaments on the surface are finished with a tool.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
It was carried off to Paris during the revolutionary war,
and then discovered to be not an emerald, as had been
always maintained, but a piece of admirably tinted glass,
containing, however, a few air-bubbles. The bowl was
broken before its return to Genoa, and the pieces are now
united by a filigree mounting of gold.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>VASE OF BLUE GLASS, PROBABLY A CHALICE<br />

</div></div>

<p class='c001' >It is claimed for the famous treasures preserved in
the royal basilica at Monza, that they date from the time
of Theodolinda, Queen of the Lombards (589-625 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>).
Among them is a cup of a deep blue material which is
stated to be a sapphire. It is almost three inches in
diameter, and Mr. Nesbitt, who examined it, failed to
discover any air-bubbles. If, however, as is probable,
this cup is of glass, it gives evidence of the technical skill
of the craftsman who made it. In the same treasury are
a number of little flasks in which were preserved the oil
exuding from the bodies of martyrs—whether these flasks
came originally from Rome or from Palestine, I am unable
to say. In any case they closely resemble certain
little bottles said to be of Coptic origin, found in Upper
Egypt. There are some very similar flasks, claiming to
date from the sixth century, in the treasury of St. Croix
at Poitiers.</p>

<p class='c001' >But it is to the treasury of St. Mark at Venice that
we must go to find what is by far the largest collection of
Byzantine glass in existence. The tradition that refers
this collection as a whole to the time of the fourth crusade,
when in the year 1204 Constantinople was subjected to a
systematic pillage by the combined forces of the Venetians
and the Franks, is doubtless in the main true. But long
before this the Venetians had been in close commercial
relations with the Greek capital. The nucleus of the
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pala D’Oro</span></i>, undoubtedly a Byzantine work, dates from
the last years of the tenth century. On the other hand,
there are some objects in the treasury of considerably
later date than the twelfth century. As the little that we
know of the glass of the Byzantines is mainly founded
upon this collection, I will extract from Passini’s great
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
work<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c018'><sup>[69]</sup></a> a complete list of the examples of glass that it
contains.</p>

<p class='c001' >I. Among a series of ten chalices of which the metal
mountings bear inscriptions in Greek relating to the
consecration of the holy wine, is a hemispherical cup of
common glass, some 5 inches in height, studded with
conical points, and another of clear glass with an arcading
in low relief (xxxi. 76 and 77). In the same series is a
bowl of green glass, decorated with four quaint animals
rudely carved in low relief (xlv. 99).</p>

<p class='c001' >II. Among a set of so-called chalices, without inscriptions
or symbols, we find—1st, A vase of plain blown
glass of greyish colour,
7<span class='nom'>1</span>⁄<span class='dem'>2</span>
inches in height; it is without
ornament, but is richly mounted in filigree and jewels
(l. 116). 2nd, A bowl of plain glass, some 6 inches in
height; at the base is a series of circular button-like
projections with a stud in the centre of each (xlii. 87).
3rd, A cup of clear glass (some 6 in. high); the surface
is decorated by a series of shield-like projections similar
to those on the last (xl. 79). 4th, Another cup of coarse
glass (5 in. high) is not illustrated in Passini’s work.</p>

<p class='c001' >III. Among a series of so-called patens of various
materials we find four of glass—1st, A plate-like paten
of greenish glass (7 in. diam.), the outside incised with a
number of small circular depressions (xlix. 109). 2nd, A
paten of milky-white semi-transparent glass with shaped
margin (9 in. diam.); not illustrated. 3rd, An unmounted
shallow dish or bowl of plain glass (14 in. diam.) shaped
like the pan of a balance; eight ringed discs, standing
out in relief from the surface, surround a central circular
shield; between are facetted, pointed projections<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c018'><sup>[70]</sup></a> (lix.
110<i>a</i>) (<a href='#p11'>Plate <span class='fss'>XI.</span></a> 3). 4th, A smaller pan-like paten or
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>
hanging lamp similar to the above (10 in. diam.) is not
illustrated.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c001' >IV. Lamps—1st, A vessel in the shape of a balance-pan,
mounted as a lamp, and hung by three chains
(liv. 125). We are reminded by this of the lamps that
hung in St. Sophia, as described by Paul the Silentiary
(p. <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>). The decoration of discs and facetted points is
almost identical with III. 3. The inscription in Greek
on the silver rim maybe rendered: ‘✠ Saint Pantaleone,
help your slave Zachariah, Archbishop of Iberia! Amen!’
This connection with Iberia (Georgia) is of the greatest
interest as bearing upon the origin of this family of glass
(<a href='#p11'>Plate <span class='fss'>XI.</span></a> 1). 2nd, A bucket-shaped lamp of plain glass
hanging from three chains (hgt. 6 in.) (liv. 124). 3rd,
An ellipsoid hanging lamp of common glass (chief diam.
8 in.). On the exterior, projecting in high relief, are
carved shells, fishes, and other animals. From the
silver rim project six cloisons which formerly held
jewels; one alone remains, an oval paste of opaque
blue. Above project eight little cylindrical sockets, as
if to contain candles (liv. 123).</p>

<p class='c001' >V. Amphora-shaped vessels—1st, A cylindrical vase
of common glass, with rich mounting (total height, 20 in.)
(xxxvi. 65). 2nd, A pear-shaped vase, set with a false
metal spout to resemble an ampulla or cruet; the mounting
is of Oriental character. The glass is carved with a
design containing two long-horned rams among a conventional
leaf pattern (the glass alone 4 in. high) (li. 115)
(<a href='#p13'>Plate <span class='fss'>XIII.</span></a>). 3rd, An unmounted vase of common glass,
with handles (10 in. diam.). 4th, An unmounted conical
vase of common glass with conical neck, carved in low
relief with three conventionalised four-legged monsters
with tendril-like limbs and bodies (hgt. 5 in.) (xl. 80).<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c018'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >VI. Situlæ, or bucket-shaped vases, 1st, A situla of
clear glass of a violet tint. The design—somewhat
rudely cut with a wheel—consists of a series of figures,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
with pastoral and Bacchic emblems. The decoration is
similar in style to the engraved work found on some
late Roman glass from the Rhine district (hgt. 8 in.)
(liii. 121). 2nd, The famous situla that I have already
described when treating of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">diatretum</span></i> glass (p. <a href='#Page_72'>72</a>).
The Canonico Passini thinks that the rings of glass have
been fitted on subsequently, and that is the impression
that I formed when examining the vase (hgt. II in.)
(liii. 122). (<a href='#p14'>Plate <span class='fss'>XIV.</span></a>)</p>

<p class='c001' >VII. The vase enamelled with classical medallions
which has already been described in connection with the
enamelled glass of the Romans (p. <a href='#Page_66'>66</a>). Although, as I
have said, the figures are purely classical in style, yet the
scroll-work reminds one of the decoration on Coptic
bowls and fragments brought from Egypt (xl. 78, and
xli. 82).</p>

<p class='c001' >VIII. There remains the turquoise basin, richly
mounted in gold and gems, presented in 1472 by the
Shah of Persia to the Signoria of Venice. The only
ornament is a conventionalised hare carved in low relief
on each of the five compartments that divide the sides.
On the base is a brief dedication in Arabic to Allah. As
to the material of this vase, all I can say is that it is
<em>carved</em>; this is seen by the light reflected on the somewhat
unctuous surface; it is therefore not porcelain or
other ceramic ware, as some have thought. The slightly
waxy lustre is in favour of its being a natural stone
of the turquoise order. Some, however, have held this
dish to be of a glass paste, on the ground of the minute
bubbles on the translucent edge; but the existence of
these bubbles is denied by others, and I myself failed
to discover them (hgt. II in.) (liii. 122).</p>

<p class='c001' >I have dwelt in some detail on this little-known
Byzantine glass at St. Mark’s, for it is, as a group, of
unique interest for our history, throwing light on so
many obscure problems.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c001' >We may obtain some slight hints as to the commoner
kinds of glass in use by the Byzantine Greeks from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span>
illustrations of contemporary manuscripts. I will give
an instance of frequent occurrence. The Evangelist who
on the opening page is represented seated at his desk
engaged in writing his gospel, dips his pen into a little
flask of clear glass, of cylindrical body and straight neck.
This is a simple form, easily turned out by the blowing-tube,
without the use of the pontil. We may trace it all
through the Middle Ages, and a flask very similar in
shape is still used in the laboratory of the chemist.</p>

<p class='c001' >Apart from the more or less conventional rendering
of the human figure—and this is what we usually think
of in connection with Byzantine painting—we find two
tendencies in the minor arts of the time; one classical,
carrying on the old Greco-Roman tradition, the other
Oriental in motive and feeling. For more than three
hundred years the frontiers of the Roman and Sassanian
empires were continually fluctuating, and in this
border region, which included Armenia, Georgia,
Western Persia, and the upper waters of the Tigris
and the Euphrates, there were at this time many
flourishing centres of industry. It was probably in
some of these lands, rather than in Constantinople
itself, that we may look for the home of the school of
carving in rock crystal and in glass that we associate
vaguely with the Lower Empire.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c018'><sup>[72]</sup></a> Nor did the Arab
conquests of the seventh and eighth centuries make at
once any great changes in the arts of these districts.
It was through these lands probably that so many
Oriental motives filtered through to the west, not only
to Constantinople, but to the north and west coasts of
the Black Sea also, and thence through Poland and
Hungary to Germany. Nowhere is this Oriental influence
better seen than in the vases of rock crystal and
other hard stones preserved in the treasuries of our
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span>
Western churches, nor can we separate these vases
from the even rarer objects carved in glass. The
carving on the so-called Hedwig glasses is, as we shall
see, executed in an allied if somewhat degenerate style;
some of these glasses can be traced back to the borderlands
of Poland.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of the glass in use among the Persians and the other
subjects of the Sassanian empire (which lasted from the
end of the third to the beginning of the seventh century)
we know practically nothing. Doubtless many examples
of Sassanian glass have been turned up during the
gigantic explorations around Nineveh, Babylon, and
Susa, but till quite lately little attention has been paid
to objects of so comparatively late a date. In the Louvre
are some fragments of glass lately brought from Susa.
One piece calls for mention here. This is a large fragment
of thick clear glass which has formed the half of a
shallow circular dish, about fourteen inches in diameter.
There are some eight or nine shallow circular
depressions cut out from the sides, with a stud rising in
counter-relief from the centre of each. We are at once
reminded of certain ‘balance-pan’ hanging lamps in the
treasury at Venice—in fact, this fragment from Susa
must have formed part of a vessel almost identical with
these.</p>

<p class='c001' >But our one undoubted example of Sassanian glass
forms part of a bowl now in the Bibliothèque Nationale.
This famous vessel was long preserved in the treasury of
the Abbey of St. Denis; as in the case of an enamelled
cup preserved at Chartres, it was claimed for it that it
had been a present from Harun-ar-Rashid to Charlemagne.
The body of this bowl consists of a framework
of gold, the openings of which are filled with rosettes of
rock crystal and glass. The central medallion of rock
crystal is carved to represent a king seated on his
throne; for this reason the vessel was formerly known as
the ‘Cup of Solomon.’ The seated king has, however,
now been identified as Khosroes <span class='fss'>II.</span> (Kosrou Parviz),
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
one of the last of the Sassanian monarchs (590-628).
The rosettes of glass and the lozenges between them
are white, emerald-green, and purple, and the colours
are still brilliant. M. de Longperier, who first identified
the subject of the central medallion, has brought forward
passages from early Arab writers in which mention is
made of glass drinking-cups in use in the court of the
Sassanian kings.</p>

<p class='c001' >The question, however, of the origin of the enamelled
glass of the Saracens—one of the most burning ones in
the history of glass—receives no light from this quarter.
Nor is the problem much advanced if we turn to
Egypt to study the interesting middle period between
the first introduction of Christianity and the Mohammedan
conquest. It is only quite lately that the exploration
of Coptic tombs has thrown some quite unexpected
light on the culture of these long-neglected centuries.
Not a little glass has been found, chiefly in fragments,
and of these the date can only be inferred from the style
of the decoration. The use of thin opaque ‘painted’
enamels, quite different from the brilliant jewel-like
enamels of the Saracens, seems to have been much in
vogue in Egypt at this time. What has been found is
not very accessible so far, nor has much been done in
the way of classification. A small collection, derived
chiefly, I think, from the excavations at Achmin in
Upper Egypt, has lately been purchased by the Victoria
and Albert Museum (from M. Richard). The little
bottles of various simple shapes call to mind those preserved
in the treasuries of certain European churches
(see above, p. <a href='#Page_99'>99</a>). One slim spindle-shaped vessel
reminds one a little of the vase with Greek inscription
found in the South-Saxon cemetery near Worthing (p. <a href='#Page_107'>107</a>).
Among the fragments is one delicately painted in thin
enamels in Egypto-Roman manner—we see a flying bird
and the stalks and seed-vessels of the lotus; others are
decorated with <i>entrelacs</i> of Byzantine character, also in a
thin opaque enamel; but on the majority of these fragments
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
the subject and the design are thoroughly Saracenic.
Some ribbed bowls (in shape identical with those from
the later Celtic tombs of North Italy) have been added
lately to the British Museum collection; they come from
Upper Egypt; the scroll-like decoration in a manganese
brown enamel is of distinctly Byzantine character.
Though these ribbed bowls may possibly be of later
date, they at any rate carry on the tradition of pre-Arab
times.</p>

<p class='c001' >Those who have visited the natron lakes of Lower
Egypt (three days’ journey to the south-west of Cairo),
declare that there is evidence that the brine and the saline
deposits have been worked more or less continuously
from Roman times. The natron is still extracted from
the lakes by the <i>fellahin</i> in the dry season. The impure
sub-carbonate of soda forms a cake beneath the coating
of common salt, and lies also upon the ground around.
Near the village of Zakook fragments have been found
that point to the existence of glass-works in former days—this
is indeed probably the site of the town of Nitria.
A French traveller of the eighteenth century speaks of
seeing near here ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trois verreries abandonnées</span></i>’ (<cite>Voyages
en Égypte par le Sieur Granger</cite>, 1745). Indeed the ruins
of three conical buildings are still to be seen; the stones
are fused on the edges, and plentiful scoriæ of common
green glass lie around. Some of the enamelled lamps
of Saracenic style, now so much prized by collectors, may
perhaps have come from monasteries in this neighbourhood.
There are besides these a few lamps (as that from
Siti Mariam, reproduced in the late Mr. Butler’s <cite>Coptic
Churches of Egypt</cite>) which are of quite a distinct
character. These lamps are set round with blue bosses
and little plaques; there is, however, no ground for
attributing any great antiquity to such work.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_8 c006'     >We must now turn to the Germanic tribes of the
north. Thanks to the late conversion of these
tribes to Christianity, we have in the objects
found in their graves a comparatively rich store of
information, up to as late a date as the sixth and seventh
centuries.</p>

<p class='c001' >A few rare specimens of glass of an essentially
Byzantine character have been found in these pagan
cemeteries. The most remarkable, perhaps, is the tall,
somewhat spindle-shaped vase discovered in 1894 in a
South-Saxon cemetery at the foot of the South Downs,
some five miles to the west of Worthing.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c018'><sup>[73]</sup></a> The design
which encircles the body of this vase has been engraved
somewhat summarily with the wheel; we see a hound
pursuing two hares—formal fern-like fronds rise between.
The Greek inscription round the top in large letters is
similarly cut; the expression ✠
Ο ΥΓΙΕΝΩΝ ΧΡΩ
may be
regarded as equivalent to the Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Utere feliciter</span></i>—‘May
the draught do you good!’ In this little vase
we have perhaps the latest example of classical glass of
sepulchral origin.</p>

<p class='c001' >The glass of our Anglo-Saxon ancestors must be
considered in connection with that found in the graves
of kindred tribes on the Continent. Of these, the most
important are the Frankish people who dwelt for some
time before their conversion to Christianity in the district
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
between the Rhine and the Ardennes. It is here, more
especially in the middle valley of the Meuse, about
Namur and Liége, that the most important finds have
been made; the more elaborate examples, at any rate, of
this Franko-Saxon<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c018'><sup>[74]</sup></a> glass were possibly manufactured
in this district.</p>

<p class='c001' >Now the importance for us of this glass from pagan
cemeteries lies in the fact that in it we have the latest
important and independent group of glass of which anything
is known, until we come to the Saracenic enamelled
ware of the thirteenth century. In England, indeed, the
gap extends to a much later period; but in the case of
Western Germany there is some reason to believe that
the Frankish fashions and traditions of glass-making were
carried on without any break during the Middle Ages—that,
in fact, in this early mediæval glass may be found
a link between the glass of Roman times and that in
use in the Rhine district up to the time when the
influence of the Renaissance first asserted itself. In
Southern and Western France, on the other hand, although
the glass-workers may in places have carried on the old
workings, what they made was of no artistic importance.
We have in this case nothing equivalent to the outcome
of the renewed interest taken in the material by the
northern chieftains—the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre à fougère</span></i> was a product
of the woods and heaths.</p>

<p class='c001' >The Oriental influence—the distinguishing feature in
all the glass of which I have treated in the last chapter—is
not so pronounced in the glass of the Franko-Saxon
peoples as in their jewellery and metal-work. In these
we find the mark of influences that had their source in
the East at two if not three widely separated periods. As
for the earliest of these, it is not only pre-Roman but
probably pre-Hellenic: its relations are rather with Asiatic
than classical lands. The brooches and buckles inlaid
with garnets, and the quaint animal forms with which
the metal designs are built up, take us back perhaps to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span>
an earlier Asiatic civilisation which is best represented
in the Persia of Achæmenid times.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c018'><sup>[75]</sup></a> The second of
these periods of Oriental influence is to be associated
with the introduction of the Christian religion. Again,
at a still later time some of the older Oriental motives
crept in in a modified form with the pagan Danes and
even with the Normans.</p>

<p class='c001' >As far as glass is concerned, it is in the beads that we
see most clearly the return to the older fashions. Of
these Franko-Saxon beads the British Museum has a
great store, not only from English graves but from
those of the Franks and other Germanic tribes on the
Continent. Now these beads differ entirely from those
found in Celtic and Roman tombs. Of these last, the
dominant type—and we must confine ourselves to this—is
of a turquoise or deep blue, generally more or less
transparent, and they are often longitudinally ribbed.
In a collection of Germanic beads, on the other hand,
the prevailing colours are red and yellow, of ochry tints;
they are almost invariably quite opaque, and the patterns
are mostly built up on the surface in a way that reminds
us of the primitive glass of the Eastern Mediterranean
(<a href='#p15'>Plate <span class='fss'>XV.</span></a> 3). A herring-bone pattern of fine lines is very
characteristic, and the delicacy of the designs on some of
the beads from Allemanic graves in Switzerland and
elsewhere rivals that of the highly finished work of the
Egyptians.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of this early Germanic glass generally, we may say
that the greatest interest lies in the types that depart
most from the Roman glass which preceded it, and on
which it is of course as a whole founded. In some cases
the northern influence is only seen in a certain barbaric
magnificence—as in the examples from Germanic graves
in Italy, lately added to the collection in the Glass Room
at the British Museum. Here we see for the first time
the drinking-horn of the north; this fine specimen,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
trumpet-ended and fluted with long gadroons, is of a
deep blue glass wound round with white threads. Of
similar origin is the <i>rhyton</i>, of moulded glass of a rich
amber colour, which lies beside it. It may be noted that
this form too, in spite of its classical associations, was
originally, as the name implies, derived from the horn of
some animal. It is not impossible that these vessels
were made by local Italian glass-workers to the order of
the barbarians, on the occasion of the burial of one of
their leaders.</p>

<p class='c001' >These are, however, only local accidental finds. With
the glass used by, or at least buried with the bodies of,
our Anglo-Saxon ancestors during the two centuries
that followed their arrival in England, we have a fairly
intimate acquaintance; as I have said, it differs little
from the contemporary or in some cases rather earlier
Frankish glass of the Rhine, Moselle, and Meuse
districts.</p>

<p class='c001' >That glass was made in the south of Britain in Roman
times there is every reason to believe, and we look in
Kent for the most probable place for its manufacture, somewhere,
perhaps, not far from the estuary of the Medway
(cf. p. <a href='#Page_86'>86</a>). It is the Kentish graves again that have
yielded the largest quantity of Anglo-Saxon glass, as well
as the greatest varieties of forms. It is noticeable, however,
that specimens of what is the most remarkable and
characteristic type of Anglo-Saxon glass have been found
in many other parts of the country. I refer of course to
the horns and conical cups decorated with long pendulous
lobes or ‘prunts.’ These drinking-cups have been
found, apart from the Kentish examples, in Durham,
Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Cambridgeshire, and in the
upper Thames valley. Individual prunts (these ‘thorned
bosses’ are more substantial than the thin surrounding
glass) have occasionally turned up in excavations in
London and elsewhere. Abroad, precisely similar vessels
have been taken from Frankish graves in the Rhine
provinces. It is more remarkable that several cups so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
ornamented have been found in Illyria, in the Narenta
Valley. Mr. Arthur Evans traces these ‘thorn-bossed
beakers’ to the graves of Ostrogothic chiefs, and thinks
that their fragility may be taken as a proof of local
manufacture (<cite>Archæologia</cite>, vol. xlviii. pp. 75-84). On the
other hand, the high technical skill required in the blowing
of such glasses has led most antiquaries to regard
our English examples as of Continental origin, not
improbably from the Rhine or Meuse country.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>PRUNTED BEAKER, FROM ANGLO-SAXON BURIAL MOUND<br />
<small>TAPLOW</small></p>
</div></div>

<p class='c001' >Mr. Hartshorne (<cite>Old English Glasses</cite>, p. 119) has
attempted to reconstitute the steps by which these ‘thorn-bossed
beakers’ were made. He thinks that after the
vessel had been blown from a ‘gathering,’ lumps of
molten glass were applied one by one to the sides. ‘The
hot liquid metal acting upon the thin cooled sides of the
object caused it to give way successively at the points of
attachment under renewed pressure by blowing. The
concavities thus formed extended into the bodies of the
prunts, the projecting points of which, being seized by
the <i>pucella</i>, were rapidly drawn forward to a tail and
attached to the outside of the glass lower down,’ This,
of course, was before the vessel had been removed from
the blowing-iron, and Mr. Hartshorne finds in this fact a
reason for the prunts in this early glass always drooping
downwards, while the somewhat similar <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">stachelnuppen</span></i>,
or ‘blobs,’ on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century German
glasses, added as they were after the transference of the
vessel to the <i>pontil</i>, invariably point upwards. ‘The
whole of the pendant lobes,’ continues Mr. Hartshorne,
‘having been thus put on and quilled and ornamented,
as some examples show, the <i>pontil</i> was attached to the
base, the blowing-iron wetted off the other end, and the
closed bulb being softened at the mouth of the pot,
presently became an open cup; the mouth of the glass
was now sheared, widened, and finished, the stringing of
the upper end of the vase usually forming part of the
final operation.’</p>

<p class='c001' >The tall conical cup of olive-green glass in the British
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
Museum, found a few years ago with so many fine specimens
of Anglo-Saxon metal-work and inlaid jewellery,
in a tumulus opened by Mr. Grenfell, at Taplow on the
Thames, may be taken as an example in which these
processes may be followed (<a href='#p16'>Pl. <span class='fss'>XVI.</span></a>). The quilling or
toothing along the side of the prunts is very similar to
that often seen at the point of attachment of the handle
on Roman vases.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c018'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Now these prunted beakers are of interest for two
reasons. In the first place, we cannot find any Roman
prototype for the long drooping tears of glass. Again,
the fact of the wide distribution of almost identical pieces
would point to the necessity of throwing back the date
of origin for some considerable time. But at what point
in their wanderings did these Germanic tribes acquire
this remarkable skill in the handling of glass? The fact
that these processes were known to the Ostrogoths in the
fifth or sixth century makes an Oriental origin for this
system of decoration not unlikely. In any case, this type
of prunted surface seems to have had a special attraction
for the Germanic peoples, for we can hardly doubt that
from these old thorn-bossed beakers and horns, by continuous
tradition, the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">stachelnuppen</span></i> on the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">krautstrunk</span></i>
and the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemer</span></i> of the sixteenth century were derived.</p>

<p class='c001' >Much more numerous in the Anglo-Saxon tombs
are—1st, the little bottles of simple form often stringed
spirally round the neck (or in other cases the stringing
may be applied to form rude gadroons and other patterns
on the body); and 2nd, the small wide-mouthed and
footless cups, often of bell-like section. These were held
in the palm of the hand while drinking, as we may see in
contemporary manuscripts and perhaps in the Bayeux
tapestry.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c018'><sup>[77]</sup></a> They are true tumblers in the original sense
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>
of the word, in that they have no foot and will not stand
upright. A very similar form is common in Merovingian
graves.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>DRINKING CUPS FROM ANGLO-SAXON GRAVES</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c001' >The tall, conical, trumpet-shaped cups are often carefully
made and of considerable artistic merit (<a href='#p17'>Plate <span class='fss'>XVII.</span></a>);
the sides are sometimes gadrooned and fluted, and
threadings of glass of various colours are applied to
them. On a fine specimen found in the cemetery of the
South Saxons near Worthing, the stringing has been
‘dragged’ to form graceful festoons or chevrons, calling
to mind the patterns on the primitive glass of the Eastern
Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c001' >The simpler forms—the little bottles and cups—may
well have been made in some of our southern counties,
perhaps in the very glass-houses abandoned by the
Romans; at any rate in Kent, the Jutish graves from
which so much of this glass has been derived are, as I
have said, intimately associated with the earlier Romano-British
cemeteries. On the other hand, for the north of
England, we have the distinct statement made by Bede,
in his <cite>Historia Ecclesiastica</cite>, that at the end of the
seventh century the glass-workers who were brought
over from Gaul taught to the natives not only the making
of glass for windows, but also of glass ‘for the lamps in
use in the church, and for vessels for other various and
not ignoble uses.’ So again a little later, in the middle
of the eighth century, Cuthbert of Jarrow, writing this
time to the Bishop of Mainz, says: ‘If you have any
man in your diocese who is skilful in the making of
glass, I pray you send him to me, ... seeing that of
that art we are ignorant and without resource.’ That at
this later period Cuthbert should have had to send all the
way to Mainz is, I think, a point of some significance.</p>

<p class='c019' >The ensuing centuries are the most barren in the
whole history of glass. We know that in France the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
glass-workers returned to the woods to manufacture in
large quantities the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre à fougère</span></i>—common glass for
domestic use, which does not seem to have come into any
close relation with the artistic movements of the time.
Here before long all interest was centred in the manufacture
of stained glass for the windows of the churches,
and this art became of supreme importance with the
rapid development of the new architecture in the twelfth
century. Whether we in England at so early a date
manufactured glass to any extent on either of these lines
is, I am afraid, still a disputed point.</p>

<p class='c001' >It was in Germany, and especially in the intermediate
tract that for a time existed as an independent kingdom—in
Lotharingia, I mean—that the old traditions seem
to have held their ground most firmly. To Germany
from time to time during the Middle Ages came new
waves of influence from the East, by various and sometimes
very circuitous paths,—in Charlemagne’s time by
way of Ravenna and Rome, more directly from Constantinople
in the tenth century, when Otto the Great
married his son to the grand-daughter of the Greek
Emperor. About the same time we hear of Greek craftsmen
at work in German monasteries, as at Reichenau on
the lower Lake of Constance, where, by the way, a great
slab of bluish-green glass, traditionally of Byzantine
origin, is still preserved.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c018'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >But it was probably by more remote paths, through
Poland and other Slavonic lands to the east,<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c018'><sup>[79]</sup></a> that the
designs on the only specimens of mediæval glass still
existing in Germany that show distinctly oriental motives<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c018'><sup>[80]</sup></a>—if
indeed the glasses are not themselves Oriental—found
their way westward. I refer to the rare carved
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>115</a></span>
goblets, about which so much has been written in
Germany. The glass of these little cylindrical cups—they
vary in height from three to five inches—is of a
yellowish-green or brownish tint, at times indeed nearly
colourless; it contains many bubbles. These so-called
Hedwig glasses are carved in high relief on the outside:
as many as nine examples have been described by Von
Czihak (<cite>Schlesische Gläser</cite>, p. 184 <i>seq.</i>), but of these only
two can in any way be brought into connection with
St. Hedwig.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c018'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >The carving upon these glasses is deeply cut, but
excessively rude. They bear the mark of a large coarse
wheel, applied for the most part in two directions more
or less at right angles to one another, and little attempt
has been made to round off the edges and angles. We
see in the decoration—figures of lions, griffins or eagles,
as well as formal leaf-like patterns—motives that are
essentially Oriental; indeed we are taken back rather to
the Persia of Sassanian times than to Constantinople.
What is above all noticeable is the extreme degeneracy
of these motives; on some examples, as on the Halberstadt
glass, the design has become a meaningless pattern.
This, as in the case of other similar breakings up of
design,<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c018'><sup>[82]</sup></a> would point to the copying and recopying by a
semi-barbarous people of a subject the original significance
of which had been lost. In any case, we may see
in these little beakers the last examples of a dying art.
Some of them may be traced back, on the ground of their
mounting, to the fourteenth, perhaps to the thirteenth,
century, but the glasses themselves may well be considerably
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
older. The important point to remember is that
during the later Middle Ages the carving of glass was
quite unknown in Europe, and that the art of employing
the lapidary’s wheel as a cutting instrument appears to
have been lost. Indeed we do not meet with carved glass
again in any form until the beginning of the seventeenth
century, and then the rapid development of the art by the
Lehmanns and the Schwanharts at Prague is acknowledged
to have depended upon technical processes learned
from Italian carvers of rock crystal.</p>

<p class='c001' >I will now enumerate the most characteristic of these
carved glasses, basing my description in part upon the
careful account given by Von Czihak in his <cite>Schlesische
Gläser</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001' >1. In the Museum of Silesian Antiquities at Breslau.
The design consists of a vase, surmounted by a crescent
and star; on either side heraldic lions, each surmounted
by a small three-cornered shield, beyond them a conventionalised
tree; the whole most rudely cut. (Figured by
Von Czihak.)</p>

<p class='c001' >2. In the treasury of the Cathedral at Cracow. Lions
and shields as above, and eagle ‘displayed.’ It is claimed
for these two glasses that they were used by St. Hedwig.</p>

<p class='c001' >3. In the Germanic Museum at Nuremberg. Two
lions ‘passant’ in the same direction; small shields as
above and a griffin (<a href='#p18'>Plate <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c001' >4. In the Rijks Museum at Amsterdam. Eagle ‘displayed,’
two lions and triangular shields. This glass
was formerly an heirloom in the Nassau-Orange family.
On the base is engraved ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Alsz diesz glas war alt tausend
Jahr, es Pfalzgraff Ludwig Philipszen Werehret war</span></i>—1643.’
(Figured by Hartshorne and by Garnier.)</p>

<p class='c001' >The above four examples closely resemble one another;
in each case the design is relieved upon a scalloped back,
something like the linen-fold of late Gothic wood-panelling.</p>

<p class='c001' >5. In the Cathedral treasury at Minden. The glass
is of a pale honey tint. The design is formed of a lion
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
with a shield containing a triangle, an eagle displayed
and a ‘tree of life,’ somewhat similar to that on No. 1.
The elements of the design are arranged stiffly with a
wide field between. (Figured by Von Czihak.)</p>

<p class='c001' >6. Formerly in the Cathedral at Halberstadt, now in
Berlin, in private hands. Of greenish glass, only three
and a half inches in height. Design—two lions and
triangular shield.</p>

<p class='c001' >7. In the Cathedral Treasury at Halberstadt. The
design on this little glass has degenerated into a meaningless
juxtaposition of bosses, bars, and fretted bands.
(Figured by Von Czihak.)</p>

<p class='c001' >This appears to exhaust the list of these little carved
glass beakers. There is nothing in the treasury of St.
Mark’s that can distinctly be classed with them; on
the other hand, the ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voirre taille d’un esgle, d’un griffon
et d’une double couronne</span></i>,’ mentioned in the inventory of
the possessions of Charles the Bold of Burgundy, may
well have been a cup of this class (Laborde, <cite>Les Ducs
de Bourgogne</cite>, ii. No. 2753).</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_8 c006'     >In a general way, it may be said of the Oriental glass
that penetrated into Europe in the early Middle
Ages, that the type is given by carvings in rock
crystal. We can point to no example of sculptured glass
that can be compared to the magnificent vases carved out
of that mineral that we may see in the Louvre or in the
treasury of St. Mark’s. I should be inclined to place
the district where this branch of glyptic art flourished,
whether we consider works of rock crystal or of glass,
somewhere in what may be called Upper Western Asia—in
Armenia, Georgia, or Western Persia—and to refer
many of the extant examples to a date rather before than
after the Arab conquest. But all this, of course, is pure
conjecture.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of quite another type was the glass made, it would
seem without interruption during all this period, in
various parts of Syria. The industry appears by this
time to have passed in great measure into the hands of
the Jews. Benjamin of Tudela in the twelfth century
found Jewish glass-makers at Antioch and at Tyre. It
was they, apparently, who carried on the old traditions
in the manufacture of artificial pastes, coloured to imitate
precious stones. The fusible glass containing lead of
which such pastes were made had indeed been from an
early date associated with the Jews—‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vitrum plumbeum,
Judæum scilicet</span></i>,’ says Heraclius. The demand
for such work must have increased immensely with the
prevailing fashion of incrusting reliquaries, the covers
of books, and various personal ornaments with large
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>119</a></span>
coloured jewels, real or false (generally the latter), cut <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
cabochon</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is chiefly in connection with such work that there
arose a curious literature, if that term may be used for
the barbarous treatises in question. Already in Roman
times we hear of writings that describe the manufacture
of artificial gems: Pliny says that he purposely abstains
from mentioning the names of these works—he would
not help to spread so objectionable an industry. But at
that time and even later it was in Egypt that treatises
of the kind chiefly originated. The mysteries of glass-making
were there early associated with more dangerous
arts. It is mainly to writers on magic—white or even black—and
to those on alchemy that we must turn to find the
earliest examples of those strange recipes for the manufacture,
and especially the colouring, of glass, of which I
shall have more to say later on. This connection between
the arts of the glass-maker and of the alchemist arose
from many causes, some of them obscure. For example,
the vessels used in the experiments of the alchemists were
from an early date made of glass. Again, the strange
changes of colour observed when glass was stained by
copper or by gold were regarded as steps to the great
discovery itself. So that from the days of the Ptolemies
in Egypt, if not from an earlier date, down to the time of
the German alchemists and Rosicrucians of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, we find along with the
grotesque and cryptic formulas for the preparation of
gold an almost continuous chain of recipes, equally
absurd for the most part, for the colouring of glass. In
addition to this, many of these treatises, although professing
to deal with the general problem of the transmutation
of matter, are in reality concerned with the more
practical questions of making plausible imitations of gold,
silver, and precious stones—they are, in fact, handbooks
for the fraudulent goldsmith.</p>

<p class='c001' >This is especially the case with the earliest example
of the class that has come down to us, the famous
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
papyrus of Leyden, which alone has survived the destruction
that the Roman law again and again attempted to
enforce in the case of all books of magic. M. Berthelot,
whom I follow for these early writers,<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c018'><sup>[83]</sup></a> calls this papyrus
the working notes of an ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">artisan faussaire et d’un
magicien charlatan</span></i>.’ This little work, found long ago at
Thebes, is a Greek manuscript of the third century; it
contains, however, little or nothing about glass, and is of
interest merely as an early specimen of this class of
composition.</p>

<p class='c001' >Other Greek treatises of a similar character, which are
either lost or survive only in extracts or translations, are
attributed to Zosimus, a writer of the third century, who
had a section on glass; to Synesius, a Cyrenaic bishop
(400 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>), married, and half a pagan; and to Olympiodorus,
a priest of Isis, who in the sixth century kept up
some of the Hellenic traditions. The late Byzantine
scholiasts drew up summaries of these treatises and of
many others; an important manuscript of this class at
Venice gives a list of fifty-two such works. But these
Byzantine summaries are of little value to us; all grip
of fact is completely lost in the mystical jargon of the
school.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of much greater interest are the many series of practical
formulas written in Latin, beginning with the <cite>Compositiones
ad Tingenda</cite>, known to us from a manuscript of
the eighth century. Here we find a section upon the
colouring of artificial stones, their gilding and polishing,
and upon the colouring of glass generally—how it is
rendered milky by means of tin, red by cinnabar (?), by
litharge (?), and by a substance called <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">calcocecaumenon</span></i>,
the latter word doubtless a corruption of the Greek
equivalent of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">æs æstum</span></i>, or burnt bronze, the well-known
mediæval source of an opaque red. Further on
recipes are given for other colours to be applied as
varnishes. There is also a chapter on the making of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>121</a></span>
glass and some summary account of glass-furnaces,
interesting solely as the earliest example of the many
such descriptions that have come down to us. In fact,
all these writers copied one from the other, summarising
or amplifying. The same recipes, more or less intelligently
expressed, turn up again and again: we can trace
them in Theophilus, and even in such comparatively
modern writers as Neri and Kunckel.</p>

<p class='c001' >A later treatise, the <cite>Mappæ clavicula</cite> (ninth or tenth
century), follows closely upon the <cite>Compositiones</cite>. As
regards glass, we find headings—for that is unfortunately
all that remains of this section—on unbreakable glass,
on the soldering of glass, on the art of tracing trees and
fruits of all kinds upon a flask, on an indelible manner of
painting on glass, and finally, three sections on the
fabrication of pearls.</p>

<p class='c001' >I have already discussed one of the recipes of Heraclius
(or Eraclius) when describing the cemetery glasses. All
that we know of this writer is that he was a monk, and
that he probably wrote in Rome, not later than the tenth
century. The twenty-one little sections that make up his
two books are written in hexameters, and treat of <cite>The
Colours and Arts of the Romans</cite>. A third and much
larger book in prose, that is found in some manuscripts,
is of a considerably later date and of quite a different
nature.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c018'><sup>[84]</sup></a> I will now briefly summarise what the true
Heraclius has to say about glass in his two metrical
books.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the third section we are told that earthenware may
be glazed with a preparation of pounded Roman glass,
mixed with water and gum and then carefully refired.
The fourth section—<cite>De Sculpturâ Vitri</cite>—describes a
method by which glass may be first softened by smearing
it with a mixture of fat worms and vinegar, sprinkled
over with the blood of a fasting goat that had been fed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
with ivy; the glass may then be cut with a hard stone
called <i>pirites</i>. This association of goat’s blood and ivy
occurs more than once in the old recipes; for these
strange ingredients there may have been originally a
cryptic interpretation, but we should perhaps rather take
the pretended necessity of their employment as a sign
that the art of cutting glass had been lost. Then in
section v. follows the account of the writer’s attempt at
imitating the gilt glass of the catacombs, which I have
already analysed (p. <a href='#Page_92'>92</a>). The description of the manner
of cutting (<i>secari</i>) the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallum</span></i> in section xii. is more
practical; we are told of a plate of lead mounted on iron,
over which a certain hard powder is sprinkled. But here,
too, the virtue of goat’s blood is not forgotten; by its
means the diamond may be made to yield to iron. In
section xiv. a process is described by which Roman glass
may be melted and cast into moulds of chalk to form
‘fair shining gems.’ Heraclius has been called an
ignorant quack, but he well represents the views of his
time. Compared with him, Theophilus, who wrote in the
north of Germany some hundred or two hundred years
later, seems almost a modern.</p>

<p class='c001' >More important to us than any of these Western
sources of information before the time of Theophilus,
are certain Syriac manuscripts preserved in the British
Museum and at Cambridge. For our knowledge of the
contents of these I am again indebted to M. Berthelot
(<cite>La Chimie au Moyen Age</cite>, vol. ii.). In the sixth and
seventh centuries Syria had taken a commanding position,
both commercially and artistically. The trade between
the west and the east, when not interrupted by the wars
between the Greeks and the Sassanians, passed through
Antioch, and after the Arab conquest the seat of the
Caliphs was for a time at Damascus, a Syrian town. In
the history of glass, from the very earliest times down to
the Middle Ages, Syria, as represented by the coast towns
at least, has vied with Egypt for the premier position;
the two countries have always been closely connected,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span>
and at more than one time they were under the same
ruler. When we come to study the glorious Saracenic
glass of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, we shall
find that Syria has perhaps a better claim than Egypt to
be regarded as the original seat of the manufacture.</p>

<p class='c001' >These Syriac and Arabo-Syriac manuscripts (the later
sections are chiefly in Arabic) form part of the material
from which the Arabs learned the arts of the Greeks.
They claim for the most part to be translations from
Greek, above all Alexandrian Greek, writers, from
Zosimus and especially from the pseudo-Democritus.
They deal with alchemy, that is to say with ‘applied
chemistry’ and the subsidiary arts. There is, perhaps,
more of local knowledge and practical experience in them
than appears at first sight, or than M. Berthelot seems
to allow: it was the fashion then to sail under the
colours of the great men of old.</p>

<p class='c001' >Beside some scattered references to the subject in
other places, we find in the thirteenth section of the
second part of the British Museum manuscript a chapter
devoted entirely to glass—it can hardly be earlier than
the ninth century. To make glass, we are told, add ten
parts of alkali to ten of sand, grill the mixture in an oven
till it is ‘clean as pure wool.’ Here we have the preliminary
fritting described. Heat in a crucible till the
substance can be drawn out like gum, ‘then make of it
what you will—cups, bottles, boxes—as the Lord may
permit.’ If the vessels thus made tend to split during
the manufacture, ‘lay upon them a thread of melted
glass. Shape the head and other parts, then put back
the vessels in the furnace to reheat, and withdraw them
gradually [that is to say, anneal the glass carefully as a
final process].... If you wish the glass to be white,
throw in some female magnesia [<i>i.e.</i> oxide of manganese,
see p. <a href='#Page_77'>77</a>], if blue, add four mithgals of burnt antimony.’
The method of ‘cleansing’ glass by means of manganese
had doubtless been handed down from Roman times,
and the ‘burnt antimony’ is probably to be interpreted
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_124' id='Page_124'>124</a></span>
as a roasted ore of cobalt. For producing other
colours, mention is made of various substances, but I
am unable to give any reasonable interpretation of this
part; we hear of tin, lead, and borax—the preparation
of a fusible enamel would seem to be implied. Finally,
we are told—‘Do what is to be done, according to the
will of the Lord Sabaoth!’</p>

<p class='c001' >There follows on this what is perhaps the earliest
extant description of a glass furnace. ‘The furnace of
the glass-makers should have six compartments, of which
three are disposed in stories one above the other....
The lower compartment should be deep, in it is the fire;
that of the middle story has an opening in front of the
central chambers—these last should be equal, disposed on
the sides and not in the centre (?), so that the fire from
below may rise towards the central region where the glass
is and heat and melt the materials. The upper compartment,
which is vaulted, is arranged so as uniformly
to roof over the middle story; it is used to cool the
vessels after their manufacture.’<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c018'><sup>[85]</sup></a> We have also the
description of a smaller furnace, which is perhaps that
in which the more fusible glass for enamels and minor
objects of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i> was melted. Finally, an oven with
a floor of brick-earth is mentioned, for fritting the sand
and alkali. In spite of much that is obscure in this
description, we can trace in it the general type of furnace
which, doubtless handed down from Roman times, has
survived in places with few important changes to the
present day.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>MEDIÆVAL GLASS FURNACE<br />
<small>FROM AN ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPT OF RABANUS MAURUS</small></p>
</div></div>

<p class='c001' >And here I may call attention to a contemporary
drawing of a mediæval glass furnace—a source of information
as unique as it is unexpected. This is to be
found in a manuscript of an encyclopædic work, <cite>De
Originibus Rerum</cite>, compiled by Rabanus Maurus, one
of the earliest of the schoolmen. Rabanus lived in
the Benedictine monastery of Fulda, in the first half of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>
the ninth century. The manuscript in question, which
is attributed to the year 1023, has been carefully reproduced
by the monks of Monte Cassino where it is
preserved. The full-paged miniature is to be found
in a chapter headed <cite>De Vitro</cite>; I can, however, discover
nothing in the text that throws any light on our subject.
In the illustration we see to the left a nearly naked workman
who holds a mass of some green material, perhaps
the frit; another man is blowing through a tube what is
probably meant for the unfinished cup; to the left a
chalice-like vessel, perhaps the model, is depicted. Notice,
too, in the pediment of the roof (probably to be regarded
as the annealing oven) a cup with a knob for stem, and
hemispherical foot. Cups of a similar form, apparently
in these cases of metal, are found in other illustrations
of the manuscript (<a href='#p19'>Plate <span class='fss'>XIX.</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c001' >M. Berthelot has reproduced in his earlier work (<cite>La
Chimie des Anciens</cite>) several rough pen-sketches of the
apparatus used by the mediæval alchemists, taken from
the St. Mark’s manuscript mentioned above. These
drawings help us in a measure to understand the important
place taken by glass vessels of various forms in
the researches of these early experimental workers. Still
more interesting are the illustrations in the Syriac
manuscript from which I have just quoted; in these,
the modern chemist may recognise many familiar forms.
The glass vessels have chiefly reference to processes of
distillation. The most important is the alembic, a form
easily made; the neck of a long pendulous <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paraison</span></i> has
only to be heated on one side near the base, when it falls
over of itself to assume the well-known shape. We see
also flasks, standing in water or sand baths, within which
various substances are digesting; in other cases the
contents are volatilising into the turban-shaped <i>aludels</i>
placed above them.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c018'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span>
But in all this strange literature, which, starting from
the banks of the Nile in the first centuries of our era,
spread over the Byzantine empire and was so eagerly
absorbed by the first Arab conquerors, the interest in
glass is only of a secondary nature,—the great question
was the transmutation of matter and the consequent
preparation of gold. Glass, as I have said, was of
importance chiefly as a means to that end.</p>

<p class='c001' >It was far otherwise with the writer whose work we
must now examine. Theophilus, the author of the
<cite>Schedula Diversarum Artium</cite>, was, it would seem, a
monk in the monastery of Helmershausen, not far from
Paderborn, in the old Saxon land. The earliest manuscript
of his work probably dates from the twelfth century;
it is preserved in the famous library at Wolfenbüttel.
The treatise itself may perhaps be referred to the end
of the eleventh or to the beginning of the next century;
but in spite of this early date the style of the book is
modern compared with the mediæval compilations we
have lately been considering. That the German monk
Rugerus, or Rogherus, should have assumed the Greek
name Theophilus is itself a significant fact. He was,
it would seem, a hard-working goldsmith and a ‘skilled
artificer’ in many branches of the arts. He drew his
inspiration from the Byzantine East on the one hand,
and on the other from the younger civilisation that was
beginning to centre in the new kingdom that was growing
up in and around the Isle de France. To these sources
we must perhaps add the older Cluniac tradition: from
Tuscan artists also he had something to learn.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c018'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >‘Theophilus, an humble priest, servant of the servants
of God, addresses his words to all who desire by the
practical work of their hands and by the pleasing meditation
of what is new, to put aside and trample under foot
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
all sloth of mind and wandering of spirit....’ In this
book they will find ‘all that Greece possesses in the way
of divers colours and mixtures, all that Tuscany knows
of the working of enamels [<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">electrorum operositate</span></i>] or of
niello [<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nigellum</span></i>], all that Arabia has to show of works
ductile, fusible, or chased, all the many vases and
sculptured gems and ivory that Italy adorns with gold,
all that France prizes in costly variety of windows, all
that in gold, silver, copper and iron or in subtle working
of wood and stone is extolled by inventive [<i>sollers</i>]
Germany.’ We are here in a healthy northern atmosphere,
far removed from the shuffling statements and
ambiguous formulas of the oriental alchemists.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c018'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >The second book of the <cite>Schedula</cite> is concerned exclusively
with glass, but most of the thirty-one sections
deal with the preparation of stained glass for windows.
In a curious passage to be found in the prologue of this
book, Theophilus tells us that he has ‘approached the
atrium of the Holy Wisdom [<i>Agiæ Sophiæ</i>] and beheld
the <i>cellula</i> adorned with every variety of divers colours,
showing the nature and use of each.’<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c018'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >The first chapter treats of the construction of the
glass furnace, and enters at once into practical details.
A German writer (A. Friedrich, <cite>Alt-Deutsche Gläser</cite>)
has illustrated the furnaces of Theophilus by means of
a diagram, and attempts to show how they differ from
those described by the pseudo-Heraclius. All we can
say is, that while the furnace of the later writer consisted
distinctly of three parts—the main furnace with the glass
pots in the centre, the fritting oven on one side, and the
annealing oven on the other—in the earlier type of
Theophilus there is no separate building for the fritting,
which, it would seem, was done on the roof of the main
furnace. In both cases the ovens form a compact group,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>128</a></span>
heated by one fire. In the earlier furnace there were as
many as eight pots, with corresponding openings, but
these pots were probably much smaller than those of the
thirteenth-century oven.</p>

<p class='c001' >We must now turn to the materials from which,
according to Theophilus, the glass was prepared. Beechwood
logs are dried and burned, and the ashes are carefully
collected so as to be free from earth. Two parts of
these ashes are mixed with one part of clean sand.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c018'><sup>[90]</sup></a> The
mixture is roasted on an upper hearth and stirred with
an iron trowel, so that it may not liquefy, for the space
of a night and day. Note here that the ashes of the
beechwood are used directly without any previous lixiviation;
such ashes would contain, besides some alumina,
more or less lime and silica, and these substances would
pass into the glass. The glass pots are conical in form,
curved inwards round the mouth, and they have a small
lip. They are filled with the frit in the evening, and for
the whole night a fire of dried logs is kept burning.</p>

<p class='c001' >There follows what is probably our earliest account
of the process by which the gathering on the blowing-iron
is converted either into a sheet of glass or into a
hollow glass vessel. In the first case the <i>fistula</i> or
blowing-iron is dipped into the molten metal and turned
round so that a mass of glass gathers on it. You blow
gently through the tube, beating the glass at times
against a flat stone that stands by the furnace.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c018'><sup>[91]</sup></a> You
heat again the end of the long vesicle of glass, and with
a piece of wood open out the aperture which now appears
at the extremity to the full width of the glass tube. We
have here a somewhat primitive method of forming a
cylindrical <i>manchon</i>. The cylinder is now reheated in
what is apparently a separate oven—the dilating oven;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span>
it is slit lengthways and opened out with an iron
forceps and a piece of wood. When the glass has been
smoothed out into sheets it is taken to the annealing
oven, where the sheets are ranged on end against the
wall and gradually cooled. It is somewhat of a surprise
to find this ‘cylinder process’ for making a sheet of glass
described by Theophilus, while not a word is said of the
older process of ‘flashing’ or ‘spinning.’ There is some
reason to believe that the knowledge of the former
process was never lost in Germany. It was, however,
only in the seventeenth or eighteenth century that the
preparation of crown glass by means of cylinders came
into general use in other parts of Europe.</p>

<p class='c001' >Theophilus proceeds in the tenth section to describe
how a vase of glass is prepared, and we have here again
our earliest description of the process by which the
gathering on the blowing-iron is manipulated so as
this time to become a hollow vessel. In this case,
he tells us, after blowing out your gathering of glass,
instead of making an opening at the further end as in
the case of the preparation of cylinders, you separate the
bulb from the rod with a stick of moistened wood, and
make the rod adhere to the lower end of the glass.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c018'><sup>[92]</sup></a>
After reheating the glass, you now, with a piece of
wood, widen and shape as you desire the opening where
the tube was first attached. The foot is then shaped and
hollowed. (If this foot is to be regarded as a separate
piece, it is not quite clear how it is attached to the vessel.)
The handles are fastened on by means of a string of
glass taken from the pot with a slender rod of iron, and
by similar means the surface may finally be decorated
with threadings of glass. Theophilus then describes
how a simple flask with a long neck may be prepared by
swinging the bulb over your head, and then, as it cools,
letting it hang down from the end of the tube; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
vessel is then separated by a piece of moist wood; in
this case no second rod is needed. No mention is made
of the use of shears for cutting the semi-molten glass;
they are replaced in a measure by shaping tools of wood.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the twelfth section we are told of the remains
of glass mosaics of various colours found in old pagan
buildings, and how from these little cubes enamels are
made to be set in gold, silver, and copper. In like
manner it is by means of fragments of divers little vessels
(<i>vascula</i>)—sapphire, purple, or green—that the French
colour the costly glass so admired in their windows.
This is a statement of no little interest.</p>

<p class='c001' >Section xiii. treats of the manner in which the
Greeks decorate the glass cups made from ‘sapphire
stones’ with gold and silver leaf, covering the foil with
a layer of very fusible colourless enamel. The passage
is obscure, and I can only say in passing that I do not
think that the process described can be identified with
that adopted by the makers of the Roman cemetery glass.
In the next section is described the Greek method of
decorating glass vessels with the same colours—green,
red, and white—that are used in the cloisonné enamels
(<i>electra</i>). With these colours laid on pretty thickly, as well
as with a preparation of gold, ground in a mill, they paint
birds and beasts or little rosettes and knots in circles.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c018'><sup>[93]</sup></a>
The Greeks make also bowls of purple and light blue, and
flasks with longish necks, twisting around them threads
of white glass, of which too the handles are made.</p>

<p class='c001' >It may be inferred from these two sections that
Theophilus probably regarded all the artistically coloured
and enamelled vessels of his time as of Byzantine origin.
He knows nothing about the constituents of the fusible
enamels. The pseudo-Heraclius, on the other hand, has
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>131</a></span>
a chapter (viii.) telling how glass is made from lead
(calcined previously to a powder) and how such glass is
coloured. In another section the same writer refers to
the ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">plumbeum vitrum Judæum scilicet</span></i>,’ which is
ground on a slab and used as an enamel to paint on
glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >Most of the remaining sections of Theophilus’s second
book are concerned with the preparation of coloured glass
for windows, but the last of all, ‘<cite>On Rings</cite>,’<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c018'><sup>[94]</sup></a> describes
carefully a method of making articles of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i> with
a small furnace and little crucibles. Lead is here mentioned
casually as a constituent of the glass, and this,
I think, is the only reference to this substance to be
found in Theophilus’s chapter on glass. Here as elsewhere
we may note that the word <i>sapphirus</i> is used as
the equivalent of a blue glass paste (coloured probably
by cobalt), and that it is referred to as a material that is
at hand already prepared. Such cakes or slabs appear
to have been an article of commerce from a period of
remote antiquity. Something not unlike them has been
found in Babylonian excavations (p. <a href='#Page_40'>40</a>). Similar cakes
of coloured glass are still exported to China from the
Bohemian glassworks.</p>

  <h2 id='ch08' class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />GLASS OF THE LATER MIDDLE AGES IN WESTERN EUROPE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_8 c006'     >One of the chief glories of the later Middle Ages
in Western Europe is undoubtedly to be found
in the stained glass windows of the churches.
Theophilus early in the twelfth century had already made
himself master of this art, which he regarded as essentially
a French one. The preparation of these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vitraux</span></i>
involved a knowledge of the process either of spinning
the molten <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paraison</span></i> or of opening out the cylinder of
glass, both comparatively late developments of the art of
glass-blowing. In the staining of the glass we know from
extant specimens what splendid results were obtained.</p>

<p class='c001' >The composition of the window-glass of the thirteenth
century is in some ways remarkable. It contained as
much as from 8 to 10 per cent. of alumina, which we
must regard as replacing in a measure the silica, for this
constituent falls to as low as 56 per cent., and we can
hardly otherwise account for the high percentage of the
other bases—14 per cent. of lime, 17 per cent. of potash,
and often 3 or 4 per cent. of iron. The result was a
tough, somewhat horny glass, hard to work in consequence
of the short duration of the viscous stage during
the cooling. This was one reason for the smallness of
the gatherings, and the modest dimensions of the resultant
discs. On the other hand, such glass resists the
action of the atmosphere better than any made nowadays,
and the large amount of potash present probably
promoted the brilliancy of the colours. From the earliest
times the blue colouring was given by cobalt, and this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
was never of a richer and purer tint than in the twelfth
century; already in the thirteenth copper was added to
correct a tendency to purple. The famous ruby red, which
became rarer after the thirteenth century until in the
seventeenth the secret was entirely lost, was produced by
the partial reduction of a small quantity of suboxide of
copper, but in this case the colour is only developed on
reheating the glass. The more purplish tint given by a
somewhat similar treatment with gold was not known to
the mediæval glass-maker.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c018'><sup>[95]</sup></a> Manganese was of course
the source of the purple—the colour was used for flesh-tints
in the twelfth century! The green was made by a
mixture of the <i>æs ustum</i> or copper scale with a native
oxide of iron, the latter often known as <i>ferretto</i>—of this
the best came from Spain. Finally, the yellow was given
either by the sesqui-oxide of iron kept well oxidised by
the presence of bin-oxide of manganese, or (where the
surroundings favoured a reducing action) by a mixture of
sulphur and some sooty material which probably yielded
an alkaline sulphide. But in the older glass the yellow
colour was never very brilliant; at a later time a fine
yellow was obtained by a cementation process from silver,
which was applied as a chloride or a sulphide to the
surface of the glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >If I trespass beyond my limits to give this rapid
summary of what is known of the colours of mediæval
window-glass, it is because much of it will be found
applicable to the contemporary Oriental enamelled ware
and to the later Venetian glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >In view of the high technical skill thus shown in the
colouring and working of the material, nothing is more
remarkable than the almost total absence from our collections
of any glass, using that word in the narrower sense,
that we can classify as Gothic. We know, indeed, that
during these centuries much glass was made in France,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
Germany, and Italy. But for one reason or another the
material was not in favour for objects that had any claim
to be regarded as works of art. And yet during all this
time the few rare specimens of sculptured glass brought
from Constantinople, or of enamelled glass from Egypt
and Damascus, were highly prized, and it might well
be thought that the skill and knowledge to rival these
examples were not wanting in the West. Such was not
the case, however; the monasteries had ceased to be
centres of practical art industry,<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c018'><sup>[96]</sup></a> and the glass-makers
had retired from the towns to the depths of the forests,
where under the patronage of the local <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">seigneur</span></i> they
built their glass-houses, moving on from one spot to
another as the fuel became scarce.</p>

<p class='c001' >On the condition of delivering yearly to their
feudal lord a specified number of vessels, these glass
masters appear to have been freed from further imposts,
and indeed they soon began to claim special privileges.
In France some of these grants or contracts have been
preserved in local archives, and in them we have a source
of information lacking in other Western countries. Perhaps
the most significant of these patents is that granted
in 1338 to a certain Guionet. The Dauphin of the
Viennois conceded to this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître de verrerie</span></i> the right of
taking wood when it suited him from parts of the forest
of Chamborant, on condition that the said Guionet should
furnish him yearly, for the use of the prince’s household,
with the following pieces of glass:—240 beakers with
feet, known as <i>hanaps</i>; 144 <i>amphoræ</i>, 432 <i>urinalia</i>,
144 large basins, 72 plates, 72 plates without borders,
144 pots, 144 water vessels, 60 <i>gottefles</i>, 12 salt-cellars,
240 lamps, 72 chandeliers, 12 large cups, 12 small <i>barils</i>,
6 large vessels for transporting wine, and one <i>nef</i>. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span>
was certainly an ample yearly supply even for a princely
household. The practical, not to say homely, nature of
most of the objects requisitioned is obvious. The <i>gottefle</i>,
we should add, has been thought to correspond with the
later German <i>gutraf</i>; it was in that case a vase with a
long twisted neck, sometimes double, like a Persian
sprinkler; it was perhaps used for oil.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c018'><sup>[97]</sup></a> The <i>nef</i>, no doubt,
was an imitation in glass of the well-known centre-pieces
of silver in the form of a ship. The little <i>baril</i> is a form
handed down from Roman times. In Provence, as early
as the year 1316, we find mention in the inventory of the
property of the Countess Mahaut D’Artois of ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grant
planté de pots de voirre et de voirres d’Aubigny et de
Provence et d’autres païs et de diverses couleurs et bocaux
et bariz</span></i>’ (Hartshorne, p. 88).</p>

<p class='c001' >We see by this how little ground there is for giving
the credit of the introduction of the manufacture of glass
into France to King René. We shall find, however, later
on, that this great patron of the arts was one of the earliest
to take an interest in the Venetian glass of the early renaissance,
and to bring the Italian workmen into France.</p>

<p class='c001' >The word <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre</span></i>, or in the earlier form <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voirre</span></i> or
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vouarre</span></i>, was used vaguely in France even in mediæval
times for any cup from which wine was drunk. This
usage alone might be brought forward as a proof of the
general prevalence of glass vessels at an early time.
Modern French writers on glass cannot always escape
the awkward expression ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un verre de verre</span></i>.’ In England,
where the use of the word glass in this sense probably
came in somewhat later, we find more than once in inventories
of the fourteenth century the quaint combination,
‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un verre de glass</span></i>.’ In France, however, the more frequent
expression was ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un verre de fougère</span></i>,’ literally ‘a
glass of bracken,’ and we have here a double metonymy.
This association of bracken and glass may be frequently
noticed in the old French writers.</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
Long after the introduction of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> from Italy,
there were many in France who preferred to drink from
the old greenish glass; like the Germans of to-day, they
declared that the wine tasted better. Even Boileau, late
in the seventeenth century, talks of a man holding ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un
verre de vin qui rit dans la fougère</span></i>.’</p>

<p class='c001' >We see then what an important place bracken, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">feucheria
ad faciendum vitrum</span></i>, played in the old glass-works
of France. Now glass made from fern-ashes must
of necessity be of a very inferior quality, more so probably
than that made from the beechwood ashes used
from of old in Germany. The passage to the new methods
would here be much more revolutionary than in the case
of the latter country. This consideration may help to
explain the fact that while the manufacture of potash
glass survived and adapted itself to the new methods in
Germany, it became in time quite extinct in France.</p>

<p class='c001' >The chronicles and romances of the thirteenth, fourteenth,
and fifteenth centuries have been carefully searched
by French scholars to find references to glass. Some
ambiguity arises from the vague use of the word <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre</span></i>,
to which I have already referred. But when Joinville
tells us how the Comte d’Eu, in a moment of expansion,
‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dressait sa bible le long de nostre table et nous brissoit
nos pots et nos vouerres</span></i>,’ we can probably accept the latter
vessels as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verres de verre</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the royal inventories of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries, above all in those of Charles <span class='fss'>V.</span> and of his
brothers the Dukes of Anjou, Berry, and Burgundy,
where there is any mention of vessels of glass, it is
almost without exception of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre de Damas</span></i> or of <i>verre
à la façon de Damas</i> that we hear. Quite an exception
is the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goblet de voirre blanc de Flandre, garny d’argent</span></i>,
that we find in an inventory of the possessions of
Charles <span class='fss'>V.</span>, taken in 1379. Notwithstanding this, it is
evident that the French kings at this time took much
interest in the manufacture of glass. When hunting in
the forests around Paris, they would turn aside to visit
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>137</a></span>
the furnace of one of these local makers of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre de
fougère</span></i> who already claimed the privileges of gentlemen.
Thus early in the reign of Charles <span class='fss'>VI.</span> we find an entry
of a payment ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour don fait par lui aux voirriers, près
de la forest de Chevreuse, où le roy estait alez veoir
faire les voirres</span></i>.’ This was at the beginning of the
fifteenth century; later on, as we shall see, both King
René and Louis <span class='fss'>XI.</span> were patrons of the glass-makers;
and yet it is doubtful if we have in our collections any
examples of French glass which can be attributed to as
early a period as the reign even of the latter king.</p>

<p class='c019' >Of glass made in Germany before, say, the end of the
fifteenth century, we know even less than of the contemporary
production in France. Theophilus, it is true,
tells us of the manufacture of sheets of glass from
cylindrical <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">manchons</span></i>, and this was probably until the
seventeenth century a specially German process; he
describes, too, the manufacture of blown glass of simple
forms. But from his time, or at least from the time of
the pseudo-Heraclius a little later, to that of Georg
Agricola in the sixteenth century, when we find the glass
industry taking an important place in many parts of
Germany, there is little direct evidence on the subject to
bring forward.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c018'><sup>[98]</sup></a> Apart, however, from a few insignificant
little bottles, used as reliquaries (Plates <a href='#p20'><span class='fss'>XX.</span></a> and <a href='#p21'><span class='fss'>XXI.</span></a>),
nothing survives from this time. On the other hand, when
in the fifteenth century we come again upon evidences
of contemporary glass in Germany and Holland, as
above all in the pictures of the early Netherlandish
and of the Cologne schools, we find a distinct form of
goblet already established, the prototype, it would seem,
of a famous shape that was able to hold its own at
the time of the invasion of Italian glass in the sixteenth
century. There is nothing in France, still less in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
England, corresponding to the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">römer</span></i> and its various
kindred forms.</p>

<p class='c001' >In one application of glass the Germans appear early
to have acquired some skill. We may perhaps regard
the thirteenth century as the time when the use of
glass for mirrors of any size first became general; this
may account for the frequent references to them in the
literature of the time. As far back as 1250, the great
Dominican encyclopædist, Vincent de Beauvais, states
that the best mirrors are made from glass and lead (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex
vitro et plumbo</span></i>). A <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">spiegel-glas</span></i> is mentioned by a
German writer as early as the end of the twelfth century,
and by the end of the next century the mirror provided
a frequent metaphor for the poets of the time. Thus
Dante, in two passages in the <cite>Divina Commedia</cite>, speaks
of ‘a leaded mirror.’ In the <cite>Paradiso</cite> (ii. 89) Beatrice
declares that the rays of the sun are reflected from the
moon—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

      <div class='line'><i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lo qual diretro a sè piombo nasconde</span></i>’;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001' >and in the twenty-third book of the <cite>Inferno</cite> (25-26)
Virgil says to the poet, ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">S’io fossi d’impiombato vetro</span></i>—I
should not more quickly receive your image than now
my mind receives your thoughts.’ This double reference
would seem to point to a recent discovery that had
attracted Dante’s attention.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries it would
appear that although the German mirror-makers had to
import the clear crystalline ‘metal’ from Venice, the
Venetians attempted in vain to make mirrors on the
German system. The difficulty, perhaps, was to prepare
flat and even sheets of glass of any size, and this difficulty
the Germans may have surmounted by means of the
cylinder process described by Theophilus.</p>

<p class='c001' >The Nuremberg mirrors, however, so famous at a
later time, were of a different type. They were of
spherical outline, cut directly from the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paraison</span></i> of the
glass-blower; into this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paraison</span></i> a mixture of ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">piombo,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
stagno, marchesita d’argento e tartaro</span></i>’ had been introduced
before the vesicle was quite cool—so at least a
contemporary Italian writer asserts. Such mirrors were
set in painted wooden frames with broad margins. An
example of one of these may perhaps be seen in Jan
van Eyck’s famous interior in the National Gallery.</p>

<p class='c019' >If now we turn to England, the record is even more
meagre. Mr. Hartshorne, who has industriously brought
together every reference he could find to glass<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c018'><sup>[99]</sup></a> in this
country during the Middle Ages, is fain to confess that
he cannot point to a single example of what is undoubtedly
English glass made between the Norman
Conquest and the time of our Tudor kings. References
to its use in contemporary writers are much rarer than in
France. The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cuppa vitrea</span></i>, which in 1244 Henry <span class='fss'>III.</span> sent
to his goldsmith, Edward of Westminster, directing him
to remove the glass foot, to replace it by one of silver,
and to mount the whole in silver-gilt, was probably of
Oriental origin; nor can we even claim for certain as
English the two humbler vessels belonging at a later
time to his son, Edward <span class='fss'>I.</span><a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c018'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >As to the three ‘verrers’ of Colchester who paid taxes
about the year 1300, the distinction between <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vitrier</span></i> and
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verrier</span></i> does not seem to have been as sharp then as it is
now; they may well have been makers of glass windows.
It is more significant to find in Henry <span class='fss'>III.</span>’s day a
Laurence Vitrearius holding land at Chiddingfold in
Surrey, still in the time of Elizabeth a centre for the
manufacture of the native glass made of fern-ash and
sand. Again, William le Verir of the same place is
mentioned in a deed of 1301. But perhaps the strongest
case is that of John Glasewrythe of Staffordshire, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_140' id='Page_140'>140</a></span>
in 1380 had a grant of house and land at Shuerwode,
Kirdford,<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c018'><sup>[101]</sup></a> and there made ‘brodeglass and vessel’—that
is to say, window-glass and hollow ware (Nesbitt, <cite>South
Kensington Catalogue</cite>, and Hartshorne, p. 132, etc.).</p>

<p class='c001' >I reserve what I have to say of the mediæval glass of
Italy—of the early Altarists and Muranists—until I have
described the enamelled Saracenic glass which in some
measure influenced it.</p>

<p class='c001' >But before turning again to the East, I must not
omit to mention certain applications of glass that found
favour in Western Europe during the later Middle Ages;
indeed, apart from the coloured windows, such objects
constitute the only <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</span></i> of glass that can distinctly be
classed as Gothic. I group together here various devices
by means of which a design or pattern was applied to the
back of a small sheet of glass—in gold for the most part,
but other colours were sometimes used. The plaque thus
decorated was either fixed into a piece of furniture, or
simply backed with some impervious material. In this
somewhat indefinite group is included, on the one hand,
what is in fact a kind of thin mosaic; on the other, something
that passed into the variety of painted glass known
in later times as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre églomisé</span></i>. What distinguishes all
this class of decoration is that neither the colour nor the
backing is fixed by any furnace process—it is scarcely to
be regarded as an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">art du feu</span></i>, and thus lies somewhat
outside our subject.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of the so-called Cosmati mosaics, where the little
triangular pieces of glass are inlaid in marble or wood,
we have a good example in the thirteenth-century shrine
of the Confessor in Westminster Abbey. At the same
period a more elaborate means of decoration was obtained
by painting the backs of little plaques of glass with gold
and colours, and fixing them on the panels of pulpits, on
the frames of the painted reredos, or even on secular
furniture. I have seen examples of church furniture thus
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
decorated at Aachen and in the Norman churches of
Southern Italy—a pulpit at Bitonto in Apulia is a
remarkable example. But we need not go far to find a
still finer specimen of such work: the Gothic framework
of the <i>retabulum</i> that formerly was placed in front of the
high altar in Westminster Abbey<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c018'><sup>[102]</sup></a> is decorated with bosses
of glass paste cut or cast <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</span></i>, with casts of
antique gems, and, above all, with little plaques of blue
and purple glass backed with silver foil. On the upper
surface of these glass plaques a design in gold, consisting
of small medallions with animals and twining branches,
stands out in low relief. The pattern, says Viollet-Le
Duc (<cite>Dictionnaire du Mobilier français</cite>, i. 338), was
first painted on the glass with a mixture of red ochre,
wax and turpentine, and over this, before it was dry,
gold leaf was laid, the gold adhering only to the soft
ground. The effect of this external decoration is heightened
by the shadow which it throws upon the silver
foil beneath.</p>

<p class='c001' >In other examples, the pattern is painted in various
colours under the glass, and a leaf of gold, pasted beneath
the more or less transparent pigments, shows through
here and there. In all these instances the crude colour
of the gold is lowered in places by coatings of varnish.</p>

<p class='c001' >But plates of glass, somewhat similarly decorated, may
play an even more important part in the decoration of the
backs of altars, especially on the spandrels in the lower
arcades of the reredos. The decoration now becomes
pictorial, and is often most carefully executed. Or,
again, such a little glass picture may be detached and
mounted in a frame to form a pax or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">baiser-de-paix</span></i>, a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bijou</span></i> reliquary, or other small devotional object. In such
cases the gold is applied to the back of the glass by weak
gum, and the design traced with a pointed instrument
somewhat in the manner of the catacomb glasses. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>
effect may be heightened in various ways by additional
touches of pigment on the draperies, or by a glazing of
colour for the flesh-tints; the colours are worked up with
a resinous body, and silver foil in little plates and spangles
is added in places; finally, over the back is laid a piece
of tinfoil, and this is folded over the edges (M. Alfred
André, quoted by M. Molinier, <cite>Spitzer Catalogue</cite>,
vol. iii. p. 54). The back of the plate is generally found
to be protected by a kind of pitchy varnish; to fix this
some application of heat was doubtless necessary, but
in no case, I think, is the gold design in this late
mediæval work enclosed between pieces of glass which
have been subsequently fused together.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c018'><sup>[103]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >We are here concerned only with the Gothic examples
of this class of work, and of these the majority appear to
come from the north of Italy—they are probably of
Milanese or Venetian origin. There is often in these
early Italian plaques a coloured backing under the gold,
generally of a bright red, but sometimes of green or
black, and this backing shows through in places. In the
case of a very beautiful example formerly in the Spitzer
collection, the design was drawn upon the central portion
of a plate of flashed glass; although this medallion is
only
5<span class='nom'>1</span>⁄<span class='dem'>2</span>
inches in diameter, there is a distinct boss in the
centre. That such a defective piece should have been
chosen for this delicate work would go to prove the rarity
of sheets of glass with even surface at this time.</p>

<p class='c001' >In later days more colour was used in the decoration,
but such work as the magnificent <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">baiser-de-paix</span></i> in the
Louvre, which came from the chapel of the order of the
St. Esprit, does not fall within our present limit of
time.</p>

<p class='c001' >The late Marquis Emanuele D’Azeglio devoted himself
to collecting specimens of gilt and painted glass of
all ages and countries. This collection, unique of its
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
kind, he bequeathed to his native town of Turin, where it
is now exhibited in the Museo Civico. In some of the
earlier pieces, especially on one of Byzantine character—perhaps
Muranese work of the end of the thirteenth
century—the gold is laid down upon glass of very
irregular thickness. There are a few examples of Gothic
work of this character in the British Museum, at South
Kensington, and in the collection of Mr. Salting.</p>

  <h2 id='ch09' class='c005'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />THE ENAMELLED GLASS OF THE SARACENS</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_8 c006'     >I have here to deal with a singularly restricted
family of glass—that made in the Saracenic East
during the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth
centuries. This enamelled glass is important for more
than one reason. It is undoubtedly, as a group, the
most magnificent and decorative that we meet with in
the whole course of our history. Technically, again, the
interest of the group is supreme, for this application of
solid enamels, translucent or transparent, to the surface
of glass, was a new departure, and it preceded, as far as
we know, the use of any material of the kind in the
decoration of porcelain and fayence. The Romans and
the Byzantine Greeks, it is true, decorated their glass at
times with thin washes of opaque paints, but we have no
definite proof that they ever applied fusible lead enamels
in this way.</p>

<p class='c001' >There is every reason to believe that this method
of decoration was not in any general use in the East
before the thirteenth century. But if we are still quite
in the dark as to the origin of the art, it may be some
consolation to remember that barely thirty years ago the
few rare pieces of Saracenic glass that had reached us
were classed as Venetian. It is only quite lately that
this important ware has met with due recognition.</p>

<p class='c001' >No doubt much of the sculptured and engraved glass,
that we have for convenience of arrangement dwelt upon
in the last chapter, is of Saracenic origin; I do not,
however, remember any instance of an Arabic inscription
being found on such vessels, but on the deeply carved
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_145' id='Page_145'>145</a></span>
vases of rock crystal that seem to have formed the
models that these engraved glasses closely followed, in
more than one case tall cufic characters form part of the
decoration. I will only point to the magnificent crystal
vase which bears the name of an early Fatimi caliph
(975-996 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>), preserved in the treasury of St. Mark’s.</p>

<p class='c001' >Apart from that in daily use among the people, we
may, however, look upon the glass made during the first
four or five centuries of Arab domination as on the
whole following in the wake of the carvings in hard
stone, above all in rock crystal, then so much in vogue.
During the whole of this period the Saracens had hardly
developed any well characterised art of their own: they
followed in this, as in so many other matters, the traditions
of the countries in which they dwelt. At this
period their art was at best but a mingling of Byzantine
and Sassanian elements. But before the end of the
twelfth century a great change had come about, and
during the course of the next century there had arisen a
definite style—one that has remained ever since the type
of what we know as Saracenic art. It would be impossible
to dissociate this change from that which took
place in the West about the same time. But the Gothic
art that sprung up in the land of the Franks was but one
phase of a continuous evolution, while the wonderful
outburst that had in the main its centre in Cairo, became
either locally stereotyped or shared the decay and
neglect that overtook other branches of Mussulman
civilisation.</p>

<p class='c001' >So far as the art of glass is concerned, we may note
in the thirteenth century a strange contrast between the
East and the West. For while in both lands the
material was applied essentially to supply a scheme of
colour in decoration, in the West its use was restricted
to the stained glass in the windows of churches; in the
East the source of colour was obtained from translucent
enamels applied to the surface of glass lamps and vases.
The Saracens, in the stained glass of their windows,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span>
merely followed in the old Byzantine lines; the pierced
framework of plaster, filled in with fragments of coloured
glass, is but a development of the marble <i>chassis</i> of the
Romans and the later Greeks. In the West, on the
other hand, the art of building up pictures by means of
segments of glass was rapidly developed, while the
‘hollow ware,’ the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verrerie</span></i> in daily use, had, as we have
seen, received little attention, and it was reserved to the
few precious pieces of enamelled glass brought from the
Holy Land to find a place along with the plate and
jewellery in the inventories of princes.</p>

<p class='c001' >The fabulous wealth accumulated by the Fatimi
caliphs of Egypt (908-1171 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) became proverbial in
later days. Makrisi, writing about the year 1400, quotes
from an older writer the description of the treasure-house
of the Khalifah Mustansir Billah. This building was
sacked and burned with all its contents during a military
riot between Turkish and Soudanese troops in 1062.
Here among the vast accumulation of Oriental wealth
were, it is stated, many thousand vases of rock crystal
and others of sardonyx. We hear also at this time (but
not in the list of these treasures) of glass mirrors in
filigree frames, and of vessels of glass ornamented with
figures and foliage. How the decoration in this last case
was given we are not told, but the reference is probably
to carvings in relief: at any rate it would, I think, be
an anachronism to look for enamelled glass in this
connection.</p>

<p class='c001' >There is, however, one application of glass that we
can definitely associate with these heretic caliphs, but
this is scarcely an artistic one. The little coin-like discs
of glass stamped with an inscription in Arabic had their
prototypes in Roman times; a few rare examples have
been found with the heads of Roman emperors and
letterings in Latin. Among the Saracens these coin-like
discs continued in use as late as the fifteenth century.
In all cases, I think, they come from Egypt. The glass
discs of the Fatimi period are, however, the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>
abundant and these are of special interest, as they bear
the name of the ruler, while those of the later Memlook
times have only private inscriptions. The glass varies
from an amber tone to a dark bottle-green, but many are
quite opaque and of a purplish black. As these little
discs are of uniform weights, corresponding to parts and
multiples of the gold <i>dinar</i> and the silver <i>dirhem</i>, they
were at one time regarded as coins; they are now, however,
recognised as weights, but essentially weights for
weighing coins. Indeed a contemporary Arab writer
(985 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) distinctly states that in his day in Egypt they
used money weights of glass; and an Arab traveller of
the time mentions incidentally that such weights have
this advantage, that they cannot be readily increased or
decreased. The inscription occupies generally the whole
surface, but a few of them bear a rough design—a ‘seal
of Solomon’ or a rosette. Larger weights of glass are
rare, but some of a cylindrical form weighing more than
a pound may be seen in the British Museum. In Dr.
Petrie’s Egyptian collection at University College is a
large mass of black glass with a solid ring handle, the
whole some four inches in height. This is probably a
weight, but its date is uncertain.</p>

<p class='c001' >On the whole, the art of the Fatimi caliphs who had
their capital at Cairo (Misr) was still under Byzantine
influence. The change of style that we have dwelt upon
is rather to be associated with the Kurdish and Turkish
Emirs, who, ruling first in Upper Syria and Mesopotamia,
finally overwhelmed the effeminate and heretic
Fatimi dynasty. To find the country where the new
style arose we must look not to Egypt, but to the tract
of land lying along the frontier of the Byzantine and
Sassanian empires, from Tabriz to the north, by Mosul
to Bagdad and Bassorah. The old Persian and Sassanian
elements here doubtless prevailed over the Byzantine
tradition; but the word Persian must not be applied to
the new art, for the Turkish element was perhaps as
important as the Iranian. It was under the Memlook
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_148' id='Page_148'>148</a></span>
sultans, almost all of them Turks by birth, that the
great mosques that gave to mediæval Cairo its special
<i>cachet</i> were erected. As for the artists themselves,
though a few may have come from the Persian borderland,
they were, for the most part, of the old stock of the
land, and many were doubtless Christians.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the towns of the Syrian coast, the change of
mastership did not interfere with the work of the glass
furnaces. We have seen in the Syriac manuscripts how
fragments of Arabic are interlarded with the old indigenous
dialect in passages treating upon the manufacture
of glass. Around Hebron the manufacture of
glass on primitive lines was carried on through the
Middle Ages: a German pilgrim of the fifteenth century
speaks of the many furnaces in which the ‘black glass’
was melted: the industry is indeed even now not extinct.
There is one form of early Arab glass which we may
perhaps associate with this centre. Certain long nail-shaped
bottles, square in section and pointed at the base, have
sometimes been classed with the old primitive glass of
Egypt and Phœnicia, on the ground probably of the
‘dragged’ decoration of white on a black base found on
some of them. But Franks was undoubtedly right in
attributing these elongated flasks—they are sometimes of
considerable size—to Saracenic times.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c018'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >William of Tyre says that the glass of his native
town was exported to all countries, and Benjamin of
Tudela, the Spanish Rabbi, praises the beauty of the
glass vases there made. There were, he tells us, four
hundred Jewish glass-makers and shipowners in Tyre,
and in other cities of the coast the glass industry was in
the hands of the Jews. This was about the middle of
the twelfth century. The Jews long before that time
had, it would seem, a monopoly of glass made with
lead. It was to them, then, that the first enamellers
must have gone for their materials. An Arab writer
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_149' id='Page_149'>149</a></span>
distinguishes among the exports from Sour (Tyre) both
objects of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i> and glass vessels worked on the
wheel.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c018'><sup>[105]</sup></a> Of the glass-works of Tripoli, one of the last
towns held by the Franks, I shall have something to
say in a future chapter.</p>

<p class='c001' >Just as in the case of the glass found in Egyptian and
in early Greek tombs, so now with the enamelled glass
of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, we are once
more brought face to face with the question as to where
it was made—in Syria or in Egypt. Syria was at this
time again under rulers who had their capital in Egypt;
there are indeed few important periods in Egyptian
history when this has not been the case. Alexandria,
it is true, had fallen from its old position,<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c018'><sup>[106]</sup></a> but it is
distinctly recorded that glass was made in the fourteenth
century at Mansourah, the recently founded ‘town of
victory,’ above Damietta. At many places in Upper
Egypt, especially at Achmin, fragments, most of them,
but not all, to be referred to Saracenic times, have been
found. But on the whole the evidence for a Syrian
origin for this enamelled ware is much stronger,—I say
the <em>origin</em>, because it is just in the case of those rare
pieces to which an early date can be ascribed that we
can be certain of an Asiatic <i>provenance</i>.</p>

<p class='c001' >The enamelled glass of the Saracens forms, as I have
said, a compact group. The specimens that we have
of it are all, or nearly all, handsome pieces, worthy,
apart from their archæological interest, of a conspicuous
place in our museums or on the shelves of the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>150</a></span>
fastidious amateur. Their number is strictly limited—indeed
Herr Schmoranz has drawn up a careful list
which claims to contain every known example.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c018'><sup>[107]</sup></a> Thanks
in great measure to the researches of this expert, we are
able now to make a rough general division of this glass
into two classes:—</p>

<p class='c001' >1st. Vases, goblets, and basins of many forms,
brought for the most part from Syria. The bulk of
the enamelled glass in this division appears to date
from the thirteenth century. Several famous pieces
have for centuries been preserved in the treasuries of
Western churches. For these it is claimed that they
have been brought back from the Holy Land by crusaders
and pilgrims—filled, some of them, with earth taken from
Bethlehem or other holy spots.</p>

<p class='c001' >2nd. Lamps, obtained almost without exception from
mosques in Cairo. These lamps belong, as a class, to
the fourteenth century. Only of recent years has much
attention been given to them; they were almost unknown
to the older collectors.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c018'><sup>[108]</sup></a> The supply appears, however,
to be already exhausted. The decoration on these lamps
is on the whole more broadly treated, with less detail
and finish, than that found on the vases and goblets of
our first class.</p>

<p class='c001' >The glass itself is in all cases remarkable for the
number of minute bubbles contained in it; in some of
the lamps these bubbles are so numerous that the
material is barely to be classed as transparent. In
colour the glass varies from a pronounced bottle-green
to an amber tint; it is more rarely of a greyish white.
The size of many of the lamps and bowls must have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
necessitated the use of large melting-pots as well as
considerable skill in blowing and manipulation. The
irregular form so often to be observed in both lamps
and vases is more likely to be the result of a partial
collapse during the melting on of the enamels, than of
any defect in the original piece as it came from the glass-blower’s
hands.</p>

<p class='c001' >In composition, to judge from the analysis of a
fragment of a Cairene lamp made by Dr. Linke of
Vienna (Schmoranz, p. 42), this Saracenic glass is
essentially a normal soda-lime silicate with 69 per
cent. of silica, 15·4 per cent. of alkali, and 8·6 per cent.
of lime, thus far resembling the ordinary Roman type.
The specimen examined, however, contained in addition
to the lime as much as 4 per cent. of magnesia. As
Dr. Linke points out, the presence of this last base
would hinder the complete fluidity of the glass in the
pots and make it difficult to get rid of the bubbles.
But whether the presence of this earth in a single
specimen is in itself sufficient to prove the non-Egyptian
origin of these lamps as a class is another question.
The fact that nearly one per cent. of manganese was
found in this glass is of interest, as it shows that some
attempt had been made to ‘cleanse’ the metal.</p>

<p class='c001' >As regards the enamels on this Saracenic glass, we
find that, with one important exception, they resemble
generally in composition and character those employed
at a later date by the Chinese in the decoration of their
porcelain<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c018'><sup>[109]</sup></a>—we have a readily fusible flux containing
much lead coloured by various metallic oxides. The
opaque red is given by oxide of iron, the green by oxide
of copper, and the yellow by antimonic acid. The
presence of this last substance is of interest: Dr. Percy
found antimony in the glaze of Assyrian bricks, and I
have taken for granted that it is the source of the yellow
in the primitive glass of Egypt. The opaque colours,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>152</a></span>
including the white, are probably produced by the
addition of a little oxide of tin to the flux; Dr. Linke,
however, does not seem to have found that metal in his
analysis.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is when we come to the blue, the dominant colour
in this scheme of decoration, that a surprise awaits us.
This colour, we should almost have taken for granted,
would be derived from cobalt, for it is now recognised
that at this time the use of that substance in the painting
of earthenware (under the glaze) was prevalent in Western
Asia. Dr. Linke, however, declares ‘that even the most
subtle re-agents failed to discover any trace’ of either
cobalt or copper in the blue enamel. For the grounds
upon which he was able to attribute the origin of this
fine blue to minute fragments of <i>lapis lazuli</i>, only
partially dissolved in the flux, we must refer to the
German chemist’s report. Now as ultramarine, the
colouring matter of this mineral, contains a considerable
amount of sulphur, some of it in an unoxidised state,
it could not be used in combination with a flux containing
lead, and indeed an analysis of the blue enamel
proved it to be essentially of the same composition as
the glass of the lamps; it contained, however, as much
as 24 per cent of alkali, and this excess would ensure
a slightly greater fusibility. It will be observed that
the thick blue enamel on this Saracenic glass has considerable
translucency as seen by transmitted light, but
that the surface is always dull. In the British Museum
is an admirably executed imitation of one of these mosque
lamps, made as long ago as 1867 by M. Brocard of
Paris. The blue, in this case cobalt, differs little in hue
from that on the old lamps that stand beside it. It is,
however, somewhat cruder in effect, and the surface is
quite glassy.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c018'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >I come now to the scheme of decoration of this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
Saracenic glass. The important point to bear in mind
is that the gold has for the most part disappeared from
the surface. This gilding, however, played originally a
most important part in the decoration. The fine lines
of opaque red now so prominent were originally drawn
with a free hand upon a detailed pattern of gold, with
the object of accentuating the design. This gold brocading,
when it is preserved, is of great beauty, especially
that found upon the older pieces. Examine carefully the
tall-necked bottle in the Slade collection: the body is
covered with a fine arabesque of red lines, the pattern
being made up of long-necked birds among foliage, and
this appears poor in effect compared with the bands of
rich enamel on the shoulder and neck. The effect, however,
was very different at first when these dull red lines
were carried over a rich ground of gold, of which traces
only now remain here and there.</p>

<p class='c001' >The gold, then, was applied first—at an early stage in
the development of this family of glass it was perhaps the
only decoration; the outline was then accentuated by means
of red lines, and the coloured enamels then laid on in
thick masses. We cannot say whether the colours were
all melted on at one firing, for we know nothing in this
case of the practical arrangements of the muffle-stove.
On the exquisitely enamelled bottle from Würzburg in the
British Museum (<a href='#p22'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXII.</span></a>), perhaps technically the most
superb specimen of this class of decoration that has come
down to us, the pinkish tint of the red and the manner in
which it is gradated into the white, call to mind the use
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouge d’or</span></i> on Chinese porcelain of the eighteenth
century; the green also of the conventional foliage is here
shaded into the opaque white. The blue ground of the
central medallion is of a brilliant turquoise, quite unapproached
in other examples; the surface, however, of
this blue enamel is in this case glassy and quite unlike
the dead surface that we see on the mosque lamps. Are
we to regard this opaque turquoise enamel as also based
upon <i>lapis lazuli</i>, or rather as a soda-copper silicate?</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
As to the motives of the enamelled decoration—if
figure subjects are absent from the mosque lamps, they
are of frequent occurrence on the bottles and goblets:
there we have polo-players and falconers mounted on
horses, yellow, pink, and white; seated figures drinking
and feasting or playing on musical instruments—always
the same jovial, round-faced type; in only one instance
have I noticed an elderly man with a beard. We sometimes
find a frieze with dogs chasing stags and hares, or
it may be a row of conventional lions. Birds are still
more frequent—flying geese, as in the background of the
hunting scenes, or long-necked herons forming part of
the ornamental design of the field. Certain quaint little
fishes with big heads and long fins, always of the same
form, are not uncommon on the vases and cups; they are
sometimes arranged herring-bone fashion; in one case,
indeed, these little fishes are found on a mosque lamp.</p>

<p class='c001' >But the more conspicuous part of the decoration is
formed by bands of tall cufic<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c018'><sup>[111]</sup></a> letters and by flowers,
more or less schematised. Apart from a fleur-de-lis,
which occurs chiefly in medallions, the most important
flower is the Oriental lotus. This flower as it appears
relieved on a blue ground in the later mosque lamps is
identical in drawing with the lotus that we see so frequently
in Indian and Chinese art. It is often combined
with what at first sight appears to be another flower,
treated <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en rosette</span></i>, with an involucre of six oval and six
triangular petals, and an indication of a seed-vessel in
the centre; but this again may perhaps be only the same
lotus-flower seen full-face. In some cases, as on certain
mosque lamps, these flowers, broadly treated, form the
sole decoration; but more often the floral design passes
into the formal schematised patterns so characteristic of
Arab art at this time.</p>

</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c001' >The medallions that interrupt the broad bands are an
essential part of the decoration; they are filled sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span>
with inscriptions, generally in this case in the <i>nashki</i> or
running script, or more often with certain badges, which are
of much interest in connection with the heraldry, if it can
be so called, of the day. These badges are derived from
the most divergent sources: there is one simple design
that resembles the cartouche of an old Egyptian king—it
has even been read as ‘Lord of the Upper and Lower
Country’ (a good example may be found on a bottle at
South Kensington). Another badge takes the form of a
strange bird with long tail-feathers, undoubtedly derived
from the imperial phœnix of China; any hesitation as to
the origin of this design is removed on observing in the
field certain little curly clouds, an essentially Chinese
motive. A sword, a pair of polo-sticks, or still more
often a cup, charged upon a fesse or band which divides
the medallion, are badges of more local origin. The
same may probably be said of the eagle variously displayed,
which in one example, in the British Museum,
occurs exceptionally upon an ovoid shield. In some cases
the Memlook sultans and emirs adopted ‘canting badges’
based upon their Turki names; as, for example, the well-known
duck of the Sultan Kelaoun. The identification,
however, of the owner, or the date of a vase or lamp from
these badges alone, is, in the absence of an inscription, a
somewhat hazardous proceeding.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is a curious fact that we have only two instances of
a signature of an artist in all this series of enamelled
glass. On a lamp from the Mannheim collection, now,
I think, belonging to Mr. Pierpont Morgan, an inscription
in running characters on the foot has been read:
‘Work of the poor slave Ali, son of Mohammed Ar
Ramaki (?), God protect him’ (Schmoranz, p. 67). It is
the same Ali, apparently, who signs his name on another
lamp described by Artin Pasha.</p>

<p class='c001' >I should say at once that these mosque lamps are
more properly of the nature of lanterns—the lamp itself
was suspended inside them. I do not know, however, of
any example of these little internal lamps in our European
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span>
collections, unless it be one of gilt green glass now at
South Kensington (<a href='#p24'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXIV.</span></a> 2). This lamp, however,
is somewhat large for the position assigned to it, and
it certainly resembles those sometimes found in Coptic
churches.</p>

<p class='c001' >These large lamps or lanterns were suspended by
chains from the roof or from the arcades of the mosque.
From the Sultan Hassan mosque alone have come
twenty-one glass lamps, now in the Arab Museum at
Cairo, and there are others from the same source in our
home collections. The effect in the mosque when these
lamps were all lighted must have rivalled the illumination
of St. Sophia, described by Paul the Silentiary
(p. <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>). We must not forget another essential part of
the Arab lamp: this is the little sphere from which the
smaller chains that pass to the handles of the lamp
radiate. In private houses—for the general arrangement
is the same in them—this globe may be replaced by an
ostrich egg. In the mosques these spheres are of metal
or of glass; we have only two specimens of the latter
material in European collections—one of amber-yellow
glass in the British Museum (<a href='#p27'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXVII.</span></a> 2), a second,
larger and ovoid in shape, at South Kensington. There
are three others, one of blue glass, in the Arab Museum
at Cairo.</p>

<p class='c001' >A similar method of suspending the lamps was in
use in Byzantine churches, and something of the sort
may still be seen in St. Mark’s. In the pictures of the
Venetian painters of the later fifteenth century—of Bellini,
and Cima, and Carpaccio—the lamps, of a strictly
Oriental or Byzantine type, that hang from the niches
that form the background to their enthroned Madonnas,
well illustrate this arrangement.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c018'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >It may be said generally of the Saracenic enamelled
glass as of the unadorned glass of the Byzantines that
preceded it, that the lamp in one shape or another is the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
master form—no longer the wine-cup, as among the
Romans. It would be an interesting study, were the
thing possible, to trace the steps by which the later
arrangement of an outer lantern of glass grew out of the
simpler Byzantine or Sassanian prototype. But it must
be remembered that these gorgeous mosque lamps or
lanterns are quite a specialised form; they are only found,
as far as we know, in Egypt and Syria, and they belong
essentially to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The
typical Oriental glass lamp is of quite a different type—a
little cup in the shape of a truncated cone, from
four to six inches in height. This is a form that is
generally in use in the East at the present day. Such a
vessel constitutes the essential part both of the street
lanterns (the conical cup in this case passes through an
aperture in the base) and of the coronas of lights by which
the larger rooms are illuminated. In the latter case the
cups pass through apertures in a ring or disc of wood or
metal, which is itself suspended, often from an ostrich
egg, in the way already described.</p>

<p class='c001' >The little vessels are filled halfway up with water,
upon which the oil floats; the wick passes up through a
tube which is fixed at the bottom in various ways. I
have before me a cup of this description brought from
an old house in Cairo; it is of very thin, tough, greenish
glass; the ‘kick’ at the bottom is pushed deeply in and
is open at the apex. This opening has been sealed up
with some hard pitchy substance, into which the little
glass tube (of later date apparently) that carries the wick
has been fixed. In another type of these cup or beaker
lamps the base ends in a blunt point which is prolonged
by one or more knops, so as to resemble the stem of
a wine-glass without the foot.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c018'><sup>[113]</sup></a> This is the form that,
as I have already mentioned, is so often represented,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
suspended from the roof in the altar-pieces of the Venetian
painters. Such lamps are generally elaborately mounted
in metal.</p>

<p class='c001' >But the other form, the truncated cone (the ‘spear-butt’
of Paul the Silentiary), was in use in Italy at an
earlier date. In the chapel of the Arena at Padua is a
careful wall-painting of an elaborate compound corona or
lantern built up with hoops of metal to resemble a large
bird-cage. The little lamps of plain glass fitted into this
framework are of two shapes; one resembles the truncated-cone
cup just described, while the other may be
compared to a mosque lamp with the foot removed and the
body prolonged to a point. I do not know if this painting
is contemporary with the famous frescoes of Giotto
that cover the adjacent walls, but to judge from the Gothic
framework that surrounds it, it cannot well be later than
the fourteenth century.</p>

<p class='c001' >This conical cup, then, was widely employed in the
later Middle Ages for suspended lamps. It had quite
replaced the balance-pan form of lamp support of early
Byzantine days, some specimens of which, preserved in
St. Mark’s treasury, we have already described: such
pans, we should add, probably supported little standing
lamps, more or less of the well-known classical form.
But both these and the conical cups may possibly at
times have held candles, an essentially Oriental means of
illumination.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c018'><sup>[114]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >We must now return to our enamelled glass, and
consider a remarkable series of little beakers very similar
in size and outline to the lamps of truncated conical
form that we have been dwelling upon. Many of these
have now passed, from the treasuries of churches and
convents in which they had been long preserved, into
various local museums. Round more than one of them
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
a legend has grown up—the very names by which they
are known are picturesque and suggestive—St. Hedwig’s
beaker, the glass of Charlemagne, the goblet of the Eight
Priests, and nearer home the famous Luck of Eden Hall.
Such cups are to be found from the confines of Poland to
our own rude border country; indeed, the enamelled
beakers of this simple form have, for one reason or
another, been chiefly preserved in northern lands: of late
years, however, a few further examples have been brought
from Syria and Egypt. No doubt the general tradition
that these cups have been carried back from the Holy
Land by crusaders and pilgrims is well founded. It is
possible that some of them may, like the carved glasses,
have travelled by northern routes rather than by the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c001' >We see, it is true, a beaker of somewhat similar form
in the hands of the wine-bibbers, in the illustrations to
the manuscripts of contemporary poets, and even pictured
on our enamelled glasses themselves.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c018'><sup>[115]</sup></a> There is, however,
one point to be noted in many of the beakers in our
collections, that makes it difficult to believe that they have
ever been actually used as wine-cups. I refer to the
remarkable construction of the base. This point had been
overlooked by previous writers on the subject, even by
Schmoranz in his great work. It was first pointed out
by Mr. C. H. Read in a paper read before the Society of
Antiquaries (<cite>Archæologia</cite>, vol. lviii. p. 217). To use Mr.
Read’s words in speaking of one of these vessels: ‘The
goblet is provided with a foot-rim that has been separately
made and fixed on the base. The bottom of the vessel
has been pushed up inwards, in the fashion to be found
in a champagne bottle, but it has a peculiar feature in
that the actual centre, the apex of the cone thus formed,
is reflected downwards, apparently leaving a small hole
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>
through the bottom of the glass which is only closed by
the fixing on of the added foot. This feature appears to
be common in these Oriental goblets, and as far as my
experience goes, is not found in any of European make.’
Such an arrangement would surely have one practical
disadvantage if the cup had been used as a drinking-vessel—the
liquid would lodge between the false bottom
and the foot, so that it would be almost impossible to
clean out the cup, and this is a point that would especially
appeal to a Mohammedan. On the other hand,
this open ‘kick’ would be admirably adapted to the introduction
of a wick<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c018'><sup>[116]</sup></a> if the vessel before the soldering on
of the ring at the base had been used as a lamp. I
should myself be inclined to think that the little cups in
question, sold perhaps by Jewish dealers at Aleppo or
at one of the Syrian ports to wandering pilgrims before
their return from the Holy Land, were never intended
for any practical use. The peculiarity of the form may
have been a result of the prevailing use to which such
vessels were put in their own country, or at least a survival
of such a use. I should add, that for such a
suggestion—it is nothing more—I am alone responsible.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_8 c006'     >I will now pass in review some of the more famous
specimens of Saracenic glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of the ‘Goblet of the Eight Priests,’ now in the
museum at Douai (figured in Gerspach, p. 107), we have
an earlier record than in other cases. It was bequeathed
by one Marguerite Mallet, early in the fourteenth century,
along with other property, for the endowment of that
number of chantry priests. The case of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuir bouilli</span></i> in
which the goblet is preserved is a remarkable specimen of
the French art of that time. The inscription on this cup
is unfortunately now illegible.</p>

<p class='c001' >For the ‘Glass of Charlemagne,’ which has passed
from the treasury of an abbey near Chartres to the
museum of that town, it is claimed that it was presented
by Harun-ar-Rashid to the great Emperor. M.
Schefer many years ago made this cup the starting-point
of a special memoir, in which he collected a mass
of information from Arab sources. This essay may
perhaps be regarded as the earliest example of any intelligent
interest in this class of Oriental glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >The ‘Luck of Eden Hall,’ long preserved in the home
of the Musgrave family, has acquired a certain factitious
celebrity from a legend that has served as the theme of
more than one ballad, none, however, of any great
antiquity.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c018'><sup>[117]</sup></a> Like the Douai cup, it is preserved in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>
leathern case—in this instance not of earlier date than
the beginning of the fifteenth century. The ‘Luck’ is
figured in Lysons’s <cite>Magna Britannia</cite>, vol. iv.</p>

<p class='c001' >These three goblets form a compact group. In all of
them the decoration is simple, consisting chiefly of interlaced
bands or straps forming geometrical patterns.
There are no figures of men or animals, and the
colouring is for the most part confined to blue and
gold. We may, perhaps, attribute these glasses to
the beginning rather than the end of the thirteenth
century.</p>

<p class='c001' >Probably of as early a date is the goblet preserved at
Breslau (there is a photograph of it in Von Czihak’s
<cite>Schlesische Gläser</cite>). Here there is no ornament apart
from some fine arabesques of gold. This cup has long
been associated with St. Hedwig, but it must not be
confused with other so-called ‘Hedwig glasses,’ which,
as we have seen, are carved in the manner of rock
crystal.</p>

<p class='c001' >I now come to a more elaborately enamelled group, in
the decoration of which the human figure plays an
important part.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the Grüne Gewölbe at Dresden are two beakers or
<i>hanaps</i> of this class, set in rich silver-gilt mountings
of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Round one
of these cylindrical beakers runs a spirited frieze, with
polo-players, mounted on brown, white, and yellow
horses; above is a cufic inscription in gold on a blue
ground (<a href='#p25'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXV.</span></a>). On the other beaker, probably the
earlier of the two, we see a group of brilliantly clad
turbaned figures seated by a flowing stream—the water
is naïvely rendered by a meandering line of blue enamel;
the background is formed by a flight of aquatic birds.
On both these glasses, beside the usual gamut of colours—gold,
blue, red, green, yellow, and opaque white—we
find some mixed brownish tints.</p>

</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c001' >Somewhat taller than these Dresden <i>hanaps</i> is the
beaker at Wilhelmshöhe (it is some nine inches in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
height). The decoration—an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">al fresco</span></i> wine-party with
musicians—calls to mind one of the groups of figures on
the Würzburg flask. Somewhat similar is the beaker
preserved in the picture gallery at Cassel, but the
enamels on this are distinctly poorer.</p>

<p class='c001' >A beautiful beaker of this class came to the British
Museum with the Waddesdon collection. It stands upon
a French-Gothic mounting of the fourteenth century.
We see a prince seated on his throne, with attendants on
either side. The glass is colourless and clear, and among
the enamels a palish green, applied as a thin wash, should
be noted.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c018'><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Since then another goblet of this class has been
acquired by the British Museum. This cup is said to
have been dug up in the neighbourhood of Aleppo. The
glass is much decayed, in this forming an exception to
the other goblets of the class. The design includes two
conventional palm-trees, whose trunks are built up of a
series of nodes.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c018'><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >On a goblet from Coptos, in the same collection, a
number of little fish in grisaille or dull red constitute the
sole decoration. There is a fragment of glass similarly
decorated at South Kensington, which came, I think,
from Achmin. We find the same little fishes again on a
cup of glass, described as a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">godet à l’huile</span></i>, lately added
to the Louvre collection.</p>

<p class='c001' >These examples practically exhaust the list of the
lamp-shaped goblets of undoubted Oriental origin. But
it would be impossible at this point to pass over the
absolutely unique cup from the Adrian Hope collection,
decorated with a seated figure of the Virgin. This goblet
is now in the British Museum, and it is there described
as Venetian of the thirteenth century (<a href='#p01'>Plate <span class='fss'>I.</span></a>). The
glass, somewhat thick and slightly greenish in hue, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
a few drawn bubbles, in no way differs from that of the
beakers already described.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c018'><sup>[120]</sup></a> So of the shape and of the
quality and colours of the enamel. The slight ‘kick,’
however, at the base is normal: that is to say, there is
no aperture (see above, p. <a href='#Page_159'>159</a>); the cup, therefore, needs
no rim or stand. As regards the decoration, we find, in
addition to the usual colours, an inscription in Gothic
lettering, now quite black, but originally executed in
silver. I shall return to this cup in the next chapter. I
mention it here as I am inclined to find for it an Oriental
<i>provenance</i>.</p>

<p class='c001' >I have dwelt at perhaps disproportionate length on this
special type of goblet. We have here, however, a group
from a historical point of view, of exceptional interest.</p>

<p class='c001' >A small damaged goblet of cylindrical shape at
South Kensington forms a transition to the group of
larger beakers. It bears a series of medallions of blue
enamel containing a curious design—a bird of prey
seizing a duck. The cylindrical goblets with projecting
collars do not present any special point for remark.
There is some reason for regarding the quaint little
flasks, with narrow swelling necks, as an early type.
There are two of this class at South Kensington; in
both cases the glass is much decomposed. Better preserved
is the little bottle with the red eagle figured in
Schmoranz (Plate vii.); the evidence, however, for the
early date (1217) given to it is not quite conclusive.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is not known at what time the large pilgrim’s
bottle in the Domschatz of St. Stephan at Vienna was
brought from the Holy Land (Schmoranz, Plate iv.).
Much of the surface is left undecorated, and the glass
is whitened by the chalky earth with which it is still
filled. This earth is reputed to have come from Bethlehem,
and to be stained with the blood of the Holy
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
Innocents. The main design of musicians, seated
beneath a conventional tree beside a stream (represented
by a blue meander), calls to mind the decoration
of one of the Dresden beakers. Near in style to this
flask is the quaintly shaped pilgrim’s bottle in the
British Museum, that was long in the possession of a
noble family at Würzburg. I have already spoken of the
superlative quality of the enamel on this remarkable
example of Saracenic glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the cathedral at Vienna is another enamelled vase
(Schmoranz, Plate xiii.). This graceful amphora-shaped
vessel follows exactly on the lines of the water jars of
earthenware still in use on the coasts of the Mediterranean.
The blood-stained earth that it once contained is gone,
but the seal of attestation remains—strong evidence that
the bottle was purchased at Bethlehem by the German
pilgrim who brought it home. The blue is of a poor
greyish tint, and the enamels on the whole low in tone,
but the interlaced geometrical design is not the less
decorative.</p>

<p class='c001' >The little jug (Schmoranz, Pl. xxx.) now in the hands
of one of the Rothschild family in Paris, was purchased
at the Hamilton sale for £2730; in the catalogue it was
described as a specimen of Venetian glass! The enamels
are brilliant and well preserved—polo-players, mounted
on horses of various colours, surround the body. A
curious feature is a collar of wood round the base of the
neck, kept in place by a series of claw-shaped projections.</p>

<p class='c001' >The larger bottles with tall necks form a class by
themselves; they are often remarkable for the delicacy
of the decoration. On the neck of a tall and richly
enamelled example in the museum at Vienna (Schmoranz,
Pls. vi. and vii.) we find a distinctly Chinese motive:—in
addition to the well-known phœnix may be seen a
curious development of the cloud pattern, in the shape
of four many-coloured bars. There is a fine example
of these long-necked bottles at South Kensington and
another in the British Museum. The first is remarkable
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>166</a></span>
in combining on the same piece motives from many sources—the
Chinese phœnix, the so-called Egyptian hieroglyph,
together with birds and animals in many styles
(<a href='#p23'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXIII.</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c001' >The bowls and dishes form a more miscellaneous
group. These we may regard as essentially ‘table ware.’
In Persian manuscripts—in the illustrations to Hariri’s
tales, for instance—we see such vessels piled up with
fruits and cakes.</p>

<p class='c001' >The shallow plate belonging to Lord Rothschild is
perhaps the oldest example of this class in our collections.
The medallions, skilfully filled with groups of lions attacking
deer and with other similar subjects, are distinctly
Byzantine, or some would say Sassanian, in character.</p>

<p class='c001' >An interest of another kind may be found in a pair of
dishes, one bowl-shaped, the other in the form of a tazza
mounted on a tall foot, which have long stood side by
side in the Cluny Museum at Paris. These are undoubtedly
specimens of enamelled Saracenic glass, both
probably dating from the fourteenth century, the bowl,
however, somewhat earlier than the tazza. This latter
vessel is decorated with a gold arabesque combined with
the thick translucent blue enamel and the red lines so
characteristic of Saracenic glass. A label, however, still
proclaims this tazza to be ‘Style Arabo-Venitien, <span class='fss'>XV</span><sup>me</sup>
siècle.’ On the other hand, no less an authority than
Labarte (<cite>Histoire des Arts Industriels</cite>, iv. p. 546), it is
true as long ago as 1864, found in this tazza an example
of one of the processes of enamelling described by
Theophilus, and on this ground deliberately declared it to
be a Byzantine work. On the basis of a vague inscription
found on the companion piece—the deep bowl—a
whole theory of the Egyptian or Byzantine-Egyptian
origin of this enamelled glass has been built up by a
German writer (Carl Friedrich, <cite>Die Alt-Deutschen
Gläser</cite>).</p>

<p class='c001' >There is in the British Museum a large deep bowl
with a gigantic cufic inscription in blue, overlaid with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_167' id='Page_167'>167</a></span>
scrolls of white enamel. The coarsely executed but
effective decoration calls to mind that on some of the
Cairene mosque lamps. This bowl is known to have
come from Damietta, and it may perhaps supply an
argument for those who find the origin of some of the
enamelled glass in the neighbouring town of Mansourah,
where glass-works are known to have existed (Lane-Poole,
<cite>Arab Art</cite>, p. 209).</p>

<p class='c001' >We have finally a class of high-footed bowls with
lids; of these, unfortunately, no undamaged example is
known; the nearest approach is perhaps the bowl with
a perfect lid but defective foot in the British Museum.
The decoration in this case is of great interest. The
medallions in the field, with fleurs-de-lis, Chinese
phœnixes, and quaint monster-sphinxes and griffins,
should be especially noted.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Mosque Lamps</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >I now come to the Mosque Lamps, and here a more
numerous family has to be dealt with. In those instances
where the lamps can be traced back to well-known buildings
in Cairo, or again when they bear the names of
Memlook sultans or of great officers of their court, a
date can generally be assigned without much hesitation.</p>

<p class='c001' >A small lamp in the Arab Museum at Cairo, decorated
with red lines—apart from this there are only a few jewel-like
spots of enamel—bears a dedication which may be
referred to either the beginning or the end of the thirteenth
century; in either case this lamp is probably the
earliest known to us (Schmoranz, Pl. XV.). Next in
order come those bearing the name of the Sultan Malek
Nasir (the successor of Kalaoun), whose long reign extended
(with some interruptions) from 1293 to 1341. On
these lamps the polychrome decoration is already fully
developed: along with them must be placed those bearing
the name of several of this sultan’s emirs. To the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
reign of the Sultan Baybars <span class='fss'>II.</span> (1309-1310)<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c018'><sup>[121]</sup></a> probably
belongs the beautiful lamp of deep cobalt blue glass that
Mr. Pierpont Morgan obtained from the Mannheim collection.
There is only one other example, as far as I
know, of enamelling on a dark blue ground,—a lamp of
nearly the same date formerly belonging to M. Goupil.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c018'><sup>[122]</sup></a>
The only specimen apparently in our English collections
of a lamp of so early a date is the beautifully
enamelled example at South Kensington (Myers bequest),
the inscription on which probably refers to the same
Baybars.</p>

<p class='c001' >By far the greater number of these lamps date from
the latter half of the fourteenth century. We have seen
that the famous mosque built by Sultan Hassan (1347-61)
has provided numerous examples to our collections. In
these we already find less delicacy and detail in the
decoration, but the broad and effective treatment is well
suited to the position in which these lamps were placed,
suspended as they were from the arcades of spacious
mosques.</p>

<p class='c001' >The period of decline that set in after this time is
usually associated with the advance of Timur (Tamerlane).
When in the year 1400 Damascus was taken by
that ruthless conqueror, we are told that he transplanted
to his new capital of Samarkand whole regiments of
skilled Syrian artisans, and among these the glass-workers
are definitely mentioned. Others of these
men may have fled to Egypt; in any case the art
lingered on in that country for another hundred years.
According to Schmoranz, the latest known example of
this school of Oriental enamelled glass is a lamp from
the mosque of Kaït Bey (1467-1495), now in the Arab
Museum at Cairo. In this specimen we see the art in
the lowest stage of decay.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c018'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c001' >The rise and fall of this great school of enamellers
on glass covers but a brief period—a glorious interlude
in the long story of the glass-workers of Egypt and
Syria. In the latter country after this time, they appear
in a measure to have fallen back upon the older and
more primitive methods, handed down, perhaps, from
the days of Phœnician and Egyptian domination. I
have already spoken more than once of the still existing
glass-works near Hebron on the high plateau to the west
of the Dead Sea.</p>

<p class='c001' >There remain, however, to be mentioned one or two
mosque lamps which depart from the normal type.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the lamp (now at South Kensington), apparently of
green jade-like glass, which was brought with so many
others from Cairo by the late Captain Myers, the effect
is obtained by a wash of green translucent enamel over
the whole of the <em>inner</em> surface. The outside is covered
with an effective but somewhat summary decoration in
gold and red lines, without further enamelling. The
Sultan named in the laudatory inscription may be either
Sultan Hassan or his father Nasir.</p>

<p class='c001' >Another exceptional lamp now in the museum at Cairo
is well illustrated in Schmoranz’s great work (Pl. xi.).
This is a smallish lamp of green cloudy glass; the
whole of the body and neck, except a plain band at the
top, is worked into shallow, wavy ribs. It bears no
enamel, but on the surface there are traces of the gilding
that formerly covered it: this lamp came from a mosque
built in 1363. At South Kensington are two small lamps
of colourless glass of somewhat abnormal form without
decoration of any kind.</p>

<p class='c001' >I must finally mention the charming little lamp from
the Myers collection (now at South Kensington) which,
it is stated, was found in a Christian monastery in Syria
(<a href='#p34'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXXIV.</span></a> 1). The thin clear glass, with pearly patina,
the graceful, vase-like form, and, above all, the sparingly
applied but quite exceptional decoration, in which the
human figure finds a place, distinguish this lamp from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
the ordinary Cairene type. In this case the treatment of
the figures, which, as I have said, are never found on
true mosque lamps, closely resembles that on the inlaid
metal-ware made at Mosul in the thirteenth century.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c018'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >And this carries us back to the question of the origin
of this enamelled glass, and we are brought face to face
with quite a number of interesting problems which can
only be indicated here. That the application of enamels
to glass by the Saracens was prior to the use of similar
materials on porcelain by the Chinese, I have already
mentioned. It is, indeed, not impossible that this method
of decoration may have been suggested to the Chinese
potters by specimens of the Saracenic glass which, as we
now know, found their way to China at an early date.
The use of enamels of very similar constitution on metals
had, however, been known in certain parts of Europe
since the first century of our era if not earlier, and the
cloisonné enamels of the Byzantines had long been
famous. In this connection, too, we must not forget the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitrum plumbeum</span></i> with which the Syrian Jews manufactured
artificial gems. It is to materials of this kind,
true lead-fluxed enamels, that we must look for the
origin of the decoration on Saracenic glass, rather than to
the paint-like colours occasionally used by the Romans
and Byzantines.</p>

<p class='c001' >We may safely associate the apparently sudden
appearance of this richly decorated enamelled glass with
the change that came over the other arts of the Saracens
about this time, and Dr. Lane-Poole is probably right in
connecting this change with the rise of the Kurdish and
Tartar families who played so important a part in the
history of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries (<cite>Art of
the Saracens</cite>, p. 127 <i>seq.</i>). Nur-ed-din, who ruled at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span>
Damascus and Aleppo in the twelfth century, came from
the stock of the Beni Zenky, who adorned their coinage
with figure subjects taken from both Byzantine and
Persian sources. His successor, the great Saladin, came
of the Ayubi stock that had ruled in Mesopotamia. Both
families brought with them the traditions of Sassanian
art and a complete freedom from the religious scruples
of the earlier Semitic rulers. A little later the great
Monghol invasion of Genghis Khan, who founded a new
dynasty in Persia, opened the way to other influences,
this time from the Far East. During all this period, the
civilisation of the Frankish West was fighting its way
into Palestine and Northern Syria. It would be difficult
to find a parallel case in history—a case, I mean, of as
many exotic influences as were now brought to bear upon
Syria and Egypt, at work at the same time and in the
same country. In both lands one result was an outburst
of artistic splendour. This, in the first country, came to
a premature end with Timur’s devastating campaign. In
Egypt this glorious period lasted somewhat longer; but
already in the fifteenth century the Memlook sultans had
returned to the stricter rule of the faith, and by the next
century, when after a period of turmoil Egypt fell under
Turkish rule, the short-lived art of enamelling on glass
was already extinct.</p>

<p class='c001' >How completely this was so we may learn from an
interesting document discovered some time since by the
late M. Yriarte in the Venetian archives—amid the inexhaustible
store now preserved in the old convent behind
the Frari Church (<cite>La Vie d’un Patricien de Venise au
XVI<sup>me</sup> Siècle</cite>, p. 147 <i>seq.</i>). In the year 1569, Marc
Antonio Barbaro—that type of a Venetian noble, the
liberal patron of artists and writers—was ambassador at
Constantinople. The document in question is a despatch
addressed by him to the Venetian senate; on it he has
drawn in outline two designs for lamps—one a somewhat
depressed version of our old mosque type, the other what
M. Yriarte calls a ‘godet-lampe’ of elongated form,—in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_172' id='Page_172'>172</a></span>
fact, a version of our ‘spear-butt’ or cup-lamp suitable
for fitting into a wooden or metal frame. Barbaro urges
the senate to see to the execution at Murano, with the
greatest care, of as many as nine hundred pieces after
these designs, for the demand came from no less a person
than the Grand Vizier himself. There is no reference,
in the order for these lamps, to any enamelling: those
that are not plain (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">schietti</span></i>) are to be decorated in the
Venetian way (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">a reticelli</span></i>).<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c018'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >The old form was, however, kept up in those beautiful
mosque lamps of fayence, Rhodian or Damascan in style,
of which we have a few rare examples in our museums;
these, I think, were made in the days of Turkish rule, in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p class='c001' >I shall return in a subsequent chapter to the later
glass of the Mohammedans—that of Persia and of India—glass
that was for the most part influenced by
Venetian models, in part even made by Venetian workmen:
it would be hardly possible to treat of this glass
before we have said something of its European prototype.
We know practically nothing of any mediæval Saracenic
glass other than the enamelled ware of Syria and Egypt.
The little bowl of amber-yellow glass in the British
Museum, enamelled with the figure of an angel, was
considered by Franks to be Persian ware of the fifteenth
century (<a href='#p27'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXVII.</span></a> 1). With it we may compare the
already mentioned sphere from a lamp-chain in the same
collection which is of very similar glass. The decoration
of the first object is distinctly Persian, but its origin may
be sought, perhaps, in the Tabriz district or even further
north in Georgia, rather than in the more southern and
eastern districts where, under Venetian influence, a glass
industry sprang up in later days.</p>

<p class='c001' >A few fragments of glass have been brought from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_173' id='Page_173'>173</a></span>
excavations made on the site of the old city of Rhé, or
Rhages, which was destroyed by Hulaku Khan in 1250.
But there is little to be found among these that has any
bearing upon the interesting question of a mediæval
Persian glass industry, nor do I think that the evidence
of so early a date for all these fragments is by any means
conclusive. In the rubbish-heaps of Fostat or Old Cairo,
which, like those of Rhé, have yielded so many interesting
potsherds that throw light on the early history of
pottery, many pieces of glass have been found, among
them some fragments of bracelets. These are of two
types, in one case of the primitive Hebron character, in
the other built up of twisted rods of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">reticelli</span></i> glass,—these
last may undoubtedly be referred to Venice. For
the rest, these Fostat fragments point to a local manufacture
of somewhat rough glass of brilliant hues, but the
enamelled glass of which we have treated in this chapter
is, as far as I have had opportunity of judging, conspicuous
by its absence.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_8 c006'     >Before taking up the subject of Venetian glass,
it will be well to say something of another early
Italian centre of the industry. It is only of recent
years that the important part played in the sixteenth
century by the glass-workers from L’Altare, in spreading
the new methods through France and the low countries,
has been made manifest.</p>

<p class='c001' ><span class='sc'>L’Altare</span> is a little Ligurian town, situated a few
miles to the north of Savona. It belonged in the Middle
Ages to the Marquis of Montferrat, and the relation of
that family both with France and with the East should
not be forgotten in this connection. According to the
local tradition, the glass industry was established as far
back as the eleventh century by a body of immigrants
from Normandy, and a French origin has been found
for the names of the families employed in the glass-works.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c018'><sup>[126]</sup></a>
At a later date, probably in the fourteenth
century, other workmen came from Murano, so that
when by the end of the fifteenth century the skilled
glass-workers of L’Altare began to seek employment in
foreign countries, they became the principal agency by
which the newer methods of the Venetians were introduced
into Northern Europe. These Altarists must
indeed have been a thorn in the side of their Muranese
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
rivals, for, abandoning the stringent regulations by which
the Venetian government sought to hinder the emigration
of their glass-workers, at L’Altare the self-elected
consuls of the craft farmed out their men to foreign
states and towns, receiving a substantial payment in
return.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c018'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >I do not know of any specimens of glass, either of
mediæval or renaissance date, that can be attributed with
certainty to the town. At the present day, however,
L’Altare is an active centre of the glass industry. Signor
Bordoni gives a list of thirteen old families—he himself
belongs to one of them—who still carry on the craft.
These houses have agencies all over Northern Italy and
even in South America.</p>

<p class='c019' >Glass has been made at Venice, or more strictly at
Murano, for at least seven hundred years; but what we
especially think of as Venetian glass—the graceful
vessels of endless variety of form, thin and diaphanous,
in which the skill of the glass-blower attains its most
complete expression—these were the produce of a comparatively
short period, of the sixteenth century above all.
During the last fifty or sixty years of the preceding
century the Venetians in their enamelled glass were
able to give expression to the spirit of the quattro-cento,
but of the glass that was made before that time practically
nothing is known. After the end of the sixteenth, or at
latest the middle of the next century, the art enters into
a period of gradual decline, which continued until the
partial revival of our own day. But before that decline
had set in, Venetian glass-workers had spread over
Western Europe, and had revolutionised the art of glass-making.
The history of modern glass begins with that
of the Venetian <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is to the Venetian archives that one must turn for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
information if the attempt be made to trace the early
history of the glass industry of that city, and these
archives have been explored by a succession of native
inquirers.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c018'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >For the earlier periods the negative evidence is of
some importance. There is no reference of any kind to
the manufacture of glass before the thirteenth century,<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c018'><sup>[129]</sup></a>
although by this time a great part of the interior of
St. Mark’s had been covered with mosaics. Like the
enamels of the Pala D’Oro, we may probably look upon
the earlier Venetian mosaics as of Byzantine origin.
After the capture of Constantinople in 1204, the Venetians
obtained a firmer grip upon the trade of the Eastern
Mediterranean. Their factories had long been established
on the coast of Syria. ‘When Sidon fell,’ says
Mr. Horatio F. Brown, ‘the Venetians received from
Baldwin, King of Jerusalem, in return for their assistance,
a market-place, a district, and a church. This was in
fact the nucleus of a colony living under special treaty
capitulations’ (<cite>Cambridge Renaissance</cite>, vol. i.). This
happened early in the twelfth century. I shall have
something to say later on concerning the relations of
the Venetians with the Latin principalities of Northern
Syria towards the end of the next century, when the
republic engaged to pay the ‘<i>dhime</i>’ for the broken
glass that they exported. It was during this period, and
under such influences, that the manufacture of glass was
established in the republic.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c018'><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>177</a></span>
Early in the thirteenth century there is evidence of
the existence of a guild of glass-blowers. In 1224,
twenty-nine members of the <i>Ars Friolaria</i> were fined
for breaking the rules of the trade. In 1268, the
chronicler Martius da Cavale tells us, the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">maestri vitrai
Muranesi</span></i>, on the accession of the Doge Lorenzo Tiepolo,
bore in procession ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">ricche girlande di perle ... e
guastade ed oricanni ed altrettali vetrami gentili</span></i>’:
water-bottles and scent-flasks and other such graceful
objects of glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >In 1279 we hear of German pedlars at Venice—<i>Todeschi
qui portant vitra ad dorsum</i>—but each man
was only permitted to carry off ten lire worth of glass
at a time.</p>

<p class='c001' >Meantime, as in other mediæval towns, the question
of allowing dangerous trades to be carried on within
the city bounds became a pressing one at Venice. The
newly constituted <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Maggior Consiglio</span></i>—it was soon after
the famous <i>firmata</i>—issued a decree ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod fornaces
de vitro in quibus laborantur laboraria vitrea</span></i>’ should
be all destroyed within the state and see of the Rivo
Alto. But this apparently was found to be too extreme a
measure, for in the next year the decree was modified so as
to allow of the manufacture of small objects (<i>Verixelli</i>—the
French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i>) in little furnaces (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">fornelli</span></i>) under
certain conditions, and this modified regulation remained
in force until the eighteenth century. The privileged
position of Murano, which lay outside the see of Venice,
was thus firmly established.</p>

<p class='c001' >About this time, too, we hear of furnaces worked by
expatriated Venetians at Treviso, Ferrara, Padua, and
Bologna, where factories had been already established,
sometimes under treaty with Venice. It will be remembered
that as yet the republic had no territory on
the mainland of Italy.</p>

<p class='c001' >There have been some differences of opinion as to
what kind of glass was produced at this time in Venice—in
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, I mean.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>178</a></span>
Without prejudging the question as to whether anything
in the nature of enamelled glass was yet known, we
have evidence for the following statements:—that
the preparation of various descriptions of beads constituted
at that time, as indeed it has ever since, the
main staple of the industry; that in the second place,
the blowing of hollow ware for general use already gave
occupation to a separate guild of workmen; and that
finally the members of both these guilds, together with
the makers of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">rui</span></i>—the little panes of thick green
glass (similar to our ‘bull’s eyes’) still to be seen in
the windows of many old palaces in Venice—were devoting
themselves to perfecting certain new discoveries.
These related above all to the manufacture of mirrors of
glass, backed with lead, of which I have already said
something. Again, the making of lenses, the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">oglarii di
vitro</span></i> or <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">lapides ad legendum</span></i>, now became a distinct
industry. It was at this time (for instance in the year
1300) that we find the <cite>Cristallai di Cristallo di Rocca</cite>
complaining of the competition of the glass-makers.
These carvers and polishers of rock crystal were already
established as an important guild in Venice; they looked
upon the glass-workers as intruders. On the other hand,
the efforts of the latter to imitate the nobler material had
no doubt an important bearing on the development of
Venetian glass, for it was as a consequence of their
success in making an absolutely white transparent ‘metal’
that the Venetian glass-makers first acquired a European
fame. It was this <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo di Venezia</span></i> that revolutionised
at a later time the glass of Europe. At an early date, in
spite of edicts forbidding its sale to the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Todeschi</span></i>, the
unworked material, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></i>, found its way into Germany,
there to be worked up after remelting. Already in
the fourteenth century the water-power of Alpine streams
had been applied to the grinding and polishing of glass,
as, for example, at Cortina d’Ampezzo in the Italian
Tyrol. The glass-makers at the same time, or a little
later, came into competition with the carvers of jasper
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_179' id='Page_179'>179</a></span>
and agate, which stones they imitated by means of
ingenious combinations of coloured glass (<i>smalti</i>).</p>

</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c001' >So far there is no evidence that the newly developed
art of enamelling on glass had passed from the Syrian
coast to the Lagoons. The Venetian glass-makers
were still working on other lines, and with other aims.
In view, however, of the close commercial intercourse
of the Venetians with the coast cities of Syria,<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c018'><sup>[131]</sup></a> we may
well imagine that some attempts were made to imitate
the brilliant enamels of the East. But the successful
handling of these colours was not a matter to be easily
learned. There were as yet no handbooks to teach the
composition of the coloured fluxes, to say nothing of the
various devices and ‘wrinkles’ to be mastered before the
enamels could be successfully applied to the surface of
the glass. In the Aldrevandini beaker in the British
Museum we may perhaps see an attempt to overcome
these difficulties. The ‘metal’ itself is here quite of a
Venetian type, thin and absolutely white, although disfigured
by the black specks so characteristic of early
Venetian glass. There is no trace of Oriental influence
in the decoration; the three heater-shaped shields have
charges—keys, antlers, and fesses—that have been traced
back to certain Swabian towns, but the inscription in
Gothic letters—✠ <span class='fss'>MAGISTER ALDREVANDIN’ ME FECI</span>—points
to a Venetian origin. On the ground of the
heraldry and of the inscription, a date of about the year
1300 may be ascribed to this goblet. The enamels, it
should be noted, are of the poorest description; all
the well-known Saracenic colours are imitated, it is
true, but with a striking want of success.</p>

<p class='c001' >Compare with this goblet the cup from the Hope
collection that stands near it in the Glass Room. The
glass is thicker than in the last example, it is of a slightly
greenish tint, and contains a few elongated bubbles. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>180</a></span>
decoration is in its way masterly: on either side of a
throne on which is seated the Virgin with the Child in
her lap, stands an angel holding a tall candle; beyond are
the figures of St. Peter and St. Paul. As to the style
of the decoration, it is to my mind distinctly Western;
the figures might be taken from a French missal of the
thirteenth century. The <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arte Francisca</span></i> was no doubt
coming into favour in Venice at this time, but even in
the fourteenth century it was regarded as something
exotic, and I doubt if it was as yet practised by Venetian
craftsmen who, in the minor arts, long adhered to Byzantine
models. When we come to examine the technique
of the enamels, we are at once struck with their resemblance
to those on the Saracenic glass of the period.
We have here the work of one who was master of his
craft; above all, the quality of the blue enamel should
be noted and compared with that on the Aldrevandini
goblet.</p>

<p class='c001' >I think, then, that both the glass and enamel of this
cup are the work of Syrian craftsmen, possibly working
at Venice, but more probably at the court of one of the
Frankish princes who held fiefs in Syria during the
thirteenth century,—at that of Bohemond <span class='fss'>VI.</span> possibly,
prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli, or of his son
Bohemond <span class='fss'>VII.</span>, who celebrated his marriage with a noble
lady from Champagne only a few years before his expulsion
by the Saracens. It was in 1277, under the rule
of the former, that the treaty was drawn up that contains
the often-quoted—and misquoted—words, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et si
Venitien trait verre brizé de la vile, il est tenuz de payer
le dhime.</span></i>’ What is more likely than that such a goblet
may have been made by some Jewish or perhaps Christian
glass-worker for a nobleman of this thoroughly French
court?<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c018'><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Such an origin may help to account for the fact,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>
otherwise somewhat difficult to explain, that this goblet
is a unique example of its class. If the Venetians of the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were complete masters
of the art of enamel, how comes it that no other example
of the art at all comparable in excellence to this glass has
come down to us? No one, I think, now believes in
the Venetian origin of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hanap de voirre en façon de
Damas</span></i>, of the glass vessels <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de l’ouvrage de Damas</span></i>, or
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peintes à la morisque</span></i> mentioned in the inventories of the
French princes of the fourteenth century. These were
evidently decorated in an Oriental style. We must also
remember that before the end of the thirteenth century
the Christian rulers were finally driven out of Syria;
there was therefore only a brief period during which such
a goblet decorated with Christian motives could have
been made in the East.</p>

<p class='c001' >When some century and a half later the Venetians
began freely to decorate their glass with enamels, we
note an entire change both in the colours and in the
nature of the fluxes used. To this point I shall return
later on, but I may call attention here to the almost total
absence of Oriental influence in the designs found on the
Venetian enamelled glass of the fifteenth century. This
is the more remarkable when we remember that at this
time as regards other arts—their inlaid metal-ware and
the stamped leather of their bookbindings, to give but
two instances—not only is this influence strong, but we
know that Oriental craftsmen were at work at Venice.
I think that one simple explanation may be given of this
apparent anomaly, namely, that by the time the Italians
took to the practice of enamelling their glass, that art
was practically extinct in the East.</p>

<p class='c019' >It was during the course of the fourteenth century
apparently that the glass-workers organised themselves
into separate guilds or <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">arti</span></i>, governed by the rules set
out on the <i>Matricola</i> or <i>Mariegola</i>. It is from these
<i>matricole</i> that the little we know of the Venetian glass of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span>
this time is derived.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c018'><sup>[133]</sup></a> The glass-workers now obtained
many important privileges, and the town of Murano was
granted a considerable measure of self-government; but
it was not till the year 1445 that these rights were fully
established. Each <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">arte</span></i> was governed by an elected
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">guastoldo</span></i>, assisted by three superintendents, to whom it
fell among other duties to bring the petitions and complaints
of the glass-workers before the Great and the
Lesser Council at Venice. Not the least important duty
of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">guastoldo</span></i> and his lieutenants or <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">compagni</span></i> was the
periodical selection of the proof-pieces—the <em>prove</em>—to be
made by the apprentices of the various <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">arti</span></i> before they
could claim rank as masters. These tasks were inscribed
in the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Mariegole</span></i>, and from them Signor Cecchetti, in his
often-quoted paper, has extracted many examples. To
give an instance: the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Maestri di Rulli</span></i> (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Rui</span></i>, small
window-panes) had among other things to make ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">due
occhi di bo</span></i>,’ an early instance of the term ‘bull’s eyes.’
But the technical terms employed in most cases render
the interpretation very difficult. Some of the strange-shaped
vases in our collections may not improbably be
examples of such proof-pieces.</p>

<p class='c001' >After this time the working year—the period during
which the furnaces were kept constantly alight—was confined
to nine months; this was afterwards prolonged to
forty-four weeks. There was, however, plenty of work
to do during the summer vacation, which ended on
October 1, for the furnaces had now to be repaired if
not rebuilt.</p>

<p class='c001' >The number of separate <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">arti</span></i> or guilds appears to
have varied, and it was not till the fifteenth century
perhaps that the divisions that were maintained until the
last days of the republic were finally established. But
at an early date the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">fialai</span></i> and <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallai</span></i> were separated
from the <i>specchiai</i> or mirror-makers on the one hand,
and on the other from the <i>perlai</i>—the bead-makers,
more especially the makers of the ‘canes’ and pastes for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>183</a></span>
beads; a fourth guild, too, was already established for
the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">stazioneri</span></i>, or retail vendors of glass. At a later date
the <i>perlai</i> were separated into two guilds, of which one
included the makers of <i>conterie</i>, the ordinary beads of
commerce, while the other comprised, besides the makers
of the <i>canne</i> for the large beads, those who prepared
enamels in cakes for exportation. When we call to mind
that, apart from these latter purely Muranese guilds, whose
members were chiefly concerned with the preparation of
the materials, the actual makers of the beads lived for
the most part under separate organisation at Venice, it
will be evident what an important part the bead industry
has played in that city. The government probably
encouraged the subdivision of labour, which made it
more difficult for single workmen to establish glass-works
in foreign countries.</p>

<p class='c001' >In fact, the manufacture and export of beads have at
all times formed the very backbone of the Venetian glass
industry. We cannot trace this trade further back than
the beginning of the fourteenth century—by means,
that is, of definite documentary evidence—but by that
time a fleet of galleys was yearly despatched, on the
one hand to the Black Sea, on the other to Flanders
and the Thames; subsidiary centres for distribution
were established at the principal ports, and these beads
already form an important element in the cargo.</p>

<p class='c001' >Unlike the larger articles of blown glass, the strings
of beads were in every way convenient articles of commerce,
easily packed and easily valued and counted. So
much was this the case that the name <i>conterie</i><a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c018'><sup>[134]</sup></a> (compare
our word ‘counters’) was early adopted as a general term
for the commoner kinds of beads.</p>

<p class='c001' >Our English tongue is above all poor in words that
can be used in the description of works of art. For
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_184' id='Page_184'>184</a></span>
apt expressions with which to indicate specialities of
manufacture, varieties of shape or shades of colour, recourse
must continually be had, however unwillingly on
the part of the writer, to the French language. But in
one case, at least, we have our revenge. We possess in
the word ‘bead’<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c018'><sup>[135]</sup></a> a convenient term, of which the exact
equivalent, strangely enough, exists in no other language.
Nothing can be more inconvenient and more likely to
lead to misconception than the use of the word ‘pearl,’ or
‘false pearl,’ in this general sense, and yet no term more
definite has been found in either the French or the
German language. In Italian the use of the term
<i>conterie</i> is confined to certain classes of beads. The
only fault, from our point of view, to be found with our
English word is that it may be applied to objects made
of other materials than glass. A term of very similar
origin—‘paternosters’—was formerly employed for a
certain class of large beads in France and Italy, but
the use of it has never become general.</p>

<p class='c001' >We have seen that towards the end of the thirteenth
century the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallai di cristallo di rocca</span></i> fell foul of the
glass-workers of Murano, and induced the authorities
to forbid the imitation of their work in the inferior
material. Not the least important of the productions
of these workers in rock crystal and other hard stones
were the beads for use in the rosaries (to use a word of
later introduction)—the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">paternostri</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c001' >We know, too, that some such prohibition as that
referred to was revoked in 1510; and the ground for
this change of policy is found in the fact that for some
time the Germans had been in the habit of carrying
to their own country the ‘canes’<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c018'><sup>[136]</sup></a> of glass, which they
there cut and polished to form <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">paternostri</span></i>. These beads,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_185' id='Page_185'>185</a></span>
re-imported into Venice, found their way ultimately to
all parts of the world.</p>

<p class='c001' >The Venetians, we must remember, at an early date,
long before they had acquired territory on the mainland,
had established factories at Treviso, at Belluno, and
along the upper course of the river Piave. It is probable
that advantage was taken of the abundant water-power
to establish in these towns mills for the grinding and
cutting of their glass. This industry, forbidden for a
time at Murano, may have been carried on in a more or
less clandestine manner.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c018'><sup>[137]</sup></a> It was through this country,
too, that the German traders passed, and a link between
the trans-Alpine and the Italian glass industries was thus
early formed.</p>

<p class='c001' >The starting-point in the manufacture of beads is a
rod or cane of glass: according as this cane is hollow
or solid, the manufacture is carried on by radically distinct
methods.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the case of the hollow cane or tube, we start from
a ‘gathering’ at the end of the blowing-iron; this gathering
is slightly inflated to form an incipient <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paraison</span></i>,
and a rod of iron is attached to the further extremity.
This rod is seized by a boy—the <i>tirador</i>—who runs with
it at full speed so as to elongate the glass as much as
possible before it has time to cool; the thin tube, or
<i>canna</i>, thus formed may, it is said, be as much as 150
feet in length. This tube, broken into rods of convenient
lengths, then passes into the hands of another set of workmen,
living for the most part in Venice. The rods are
now carefully sorted, as to size, by women—the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cernatrici</span></i>—and
handed over to the cutter, who, seated at a bench,
cuts off equal lengths by passing the rod between a blade
or chisel held in the hand, and a similar tool fixed in
the bench, the size of the fragments being regulated by
means of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">scontro</span></i>, a semi-cylindrical block of steel.
If the object was to manufacture the little cylindrical
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span>
bugles or <i>jais</i>, the bead—if so it may be called—is now
completed. But in the case of a normal bead, the edges
had now to be rounded. With this object the aperture
of the little tubes had first to be filled with some infusible
substance; this was done by rolling them in the
hand with a finely ground mixture of lime and charcoal.
They were now placed along with a quantity of sand in
a tubular iron receptacle, which was rotated over the furnace.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c018'><sup>[138]</sup></a>
By this means the angular edges were rounded
off. The beads were then sifted from the sand and
shaken up in a bag to remove the material with which
the tubes had been plugged; finally they were sorted
into various sizes by means of a sieve, and, in the case
of spherical beads, those of irregular shape were eliminated
by rolling them on an inclined table. It only remained
for the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">lustratori</span></i> to give them a final polish by
shaking them up in a sack with bran.</p>

<p class='c001' >This was the process adopted for the smaller beads—the
<i>conterie</i>—which, before packing, were threaded on a
string by girls. The larger <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perle</span></i>, such as the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perle a
rosette</span></i>, or chevron beads, of which I shall speak presently,
had to be ground into shape on the wheel. Any
ornament or design that appears on these beads depended
of course upon the constitution of the original <i>canna</i>.
This was often built up of a succession of layers of
various colours, obtained by dipping the first gathering
into one or more pots of coloured glass, before drawing
it out to form a tube.</p>

<p class='c001' >Beads made by this process belong strictly to the
class of <em>blown</em> glass. The other system which we will
now describe takes us back to the old primitive methods
of glass-working. In this case we start from a <em>solid</em> rod
of glass, which is manipulated in the hand of the workman
somewhat like a stick of sealing-wax. Seated at a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>187</a></span>
table, he melts the extremity of the <i>canna</i> in the flame,
directed away from him by means of a blow-pipe, and
twists the thread of viscid glass around a small rod of
iron.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c018'><sup>[139]</sup></a> By this or similar methods, not only beads but
various small objects of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i> are formed. The
surface of these may be subsequently decorated by
means of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appliqué</span></i> studs and stringings of various
coloured glass, or again, the half-fused substance may
be pressed into little moulds. The spun-glass also, so
much admired a few years since, is made from rods of
glass melted in the flame of the table blow-pipe.</p>

<p class='c001' >This is the process of the <i>suppialume</i>, in which the
Venetian workmen acquired such skill in later days. It
cannot be traced further back than the end of the fifteenth
century, and its invention is associated with a certain
Andrea Vidaore. The guild of the <i>suppialumi</i> was only
finally constituted in 1648. If this process was really
only introduced at so comparatively late a date, we have
here a curious instance of a reversion to an old technique,
for it is impossible to overlook the points of resemblance
between it and the manner in which the ancient Egyptians
built up their beads.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c018'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >It must be noted that the practical difference between
the beads made by the <i>suppialumi</i> and those formed
from hollow tubes, is not one of size. Large or small
beads may be formed by either process. It is, rather, that
in the first case the ornament is superficial—it is something
added to the surface of the bead. On the other
hand, in beads made from hollow tubes, the design,
though limited in variety, is carried through the whole
bead. This is a distinction much appreciated by native
connoisseurs in Central Africa and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c001' >Among the beads made from hollow tubes there is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>188</a></span>
one type, generally of commanding size, which may
perhaps claim some attention. I refer to the great
Chevron Beads, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Perle a rosette</span></i> of the Italians,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</span></i> of the origin and date of which a not insignificant
literature has accumulated. I treat of them here,
as in by far the larger number of instances, if not in all
cases, these beads can be undoubtedly recognised as of
Venetian manufacture. These chevron beads have been
made from canes built up of concentric layers of coloured
glass. They have attracted exceptional attention from
the fact that examples have been found in so many
widely separated parts of the world, and from their
possessing, in some cases, apparently well founded claims
to great age. The arrangement and the succession of
the colours in the glass is in every case practically
identical. The canes from which they were formed have
been built up of three main concentric layers, externally
a deep cobalt blue, then an opaque brick red, and in the
centre a tube of pale green transparent glass; these
main layers are divided by thinner ones of opaque white
glass, and the dividing surfaces have been worked into a
series of chevrons or zig-zags (these chevrons are in all
cases, I think, twelve in number) so as to present a star-like
pattern on a cross section. The only variations on
this general type are as follows: the chevrons are, in a
few cases, dragged laterally so as to resemble the teeth
of a circular saw; the central tube of transparent glass is
sometimes divided by a zig-zag layer of opaque white;
and, very rarely, the external layer is green instead of blue.
In shape and size, however, these chevron beads show
wide divergences: in length they may vary from two and
a half inches to as little as a third of an inch, and the
diameter, though generally less, is in a few cases greater,
than the length. The extremities in some of the larger
and presumably older specimens are facetted, that is to
say, ground down to a pyramidal form. What, however,
we may call the normal type, is of a cylindrical shape
with rounded ends (<a href='#p15'>Plate <span class='fss'>XV.</span></a> 2).</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_189' id='Page_189'>189</a></span>
These <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perle a rosette</span></i> are at the present day made at
Murano for the African market. When in the spring of
1903 I visited the glass-works of the ‘Venice and Murano
Company,’ I was shown by Signor Andrea Rioda specimens
both of these beads and of the canes from which
they are prepared; the company was at that time executing
a large order from a French firm, for the Congo. This
work, however, is not generally undertaken by the firms
that make the ordinary <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conterie</span></i>, for these large beads
have to be separately ground and polished on a wheel—an
important point, as we shall see. They have been
made at Murano, the local tradition affirms, from time
without memory.</p>

<p class='c001' >Quite recently, in the immediate neighbourhood of
Treviso, a deposit of these chevron beads has been discovered
in a bank beside an open field; ‘bushel loads’ of
fragments were extracted, but not a single perfect bead.
They were without exception broken fragments, not improbably
‘wasters,’ thrown aside possibly by those who
were employed in grinding them. Treviso, I may note,
is a town of mills and swift-flowing streams—in fact, the
nearest point to Venice where abundant water-power could
be found. Unfortunately no light so far has been thrown
upon the age of this curious deposit.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c018'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >In general aspect, in the scheme of colour especially,
there is something unmistakably African about these
chevron beads. To say nothing of their exceptional
size, they have little in common with any other type of
polychrome bead, whether Egyptian, classical, or from
Teutonic graves.</p>

<p class='c001' >I may at once say that I consider these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perle a rosette</span></i>
as essentially of Venetian origin, and made, above all, for
the African market. How the industry arose, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_190' id='Page_190'>190</a></span>
whether the Venetians in this instance as in other cases
took the place of earlier Byzantine or Syrian glass-workers,
there is nothing to show. We know that the
Alexandrians of Greek and Roman times, like the
Phœnicians before them, traded with the native races of
Central Africa. These beads have certainly been found
in Egypt,<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c018'><sup>[142]</sup></a> especially in Upper Egypt and Nubia; it is
even said that some of the Soudanese tribes have succeeded
in making passable imitations of them.</p>

<p class='c001' >It must be remembered that the Venetians, at least
in later times, did not trade directly with inland and
barbarous races. Their business was to deliver their
merchandise at certain seaport towns where they had
factories or agencies. The goods then fell into the hands
of local merchants who distributed them by caravans or
sent them on coastways in their ships. So the Arab
traders of Egypt, reshipping the Venetian wares at Suez
or other ports of the Red Sea, would carry them in
their dhows to Zanzibar or India; and so again in
later days the merchants of Amsterdam and London,
who held at times vast stores of Venetian beads,
distributed them in Dutch or English ships to the very
extremities of the world. The trade in beads was very
active in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. At
the present day, in the warehouses of Bevis Marks and
Houndsditch, there is probably accumulated a larger
stock of beads than in Venice itself.</p>

<p class='c001' >So far we are on firm ground, nor is there anything
surprising when we are told that the large chevron beads
have been found in Central Africa,<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c018'><sup>[143]</sup></a> in the South Sea
Islands, and even in Canada and the United States. But
when we hear of examples being taken from Red Indian
grave-mounds and even from ancient Peruvian tombs, we
feel some need of hesitation before accepting the statement.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_191' id='Page_191'>191</a></span>
So of the specimens found in England, many of
them are water-worn and have an air of the remotest
antiquity: they have been extracted from wells, from
river-beds, and, it is stated, from Anglo-Saxon graves.
I may mention that these chevron beads early attracted
the attention of English antiquaries. Dr. Stukeley, who
had several in his possession, brings them up in his
disquisition on Druidical remains, and Bishop Gibson,
as far back as the beginning of the eighteenth century,
figures them in his edition of Camden’s <cite>Britannia</cite>.
Gibson mentions that when he was opening a grave
(presumably Anglo-Saxon) at Ash, a worthy friend by
way of jest placed one of these <i>glain nidr</i> or ‘serpent’s
eggs’ among the genuine ancient beads. I will not say
with regard to this attempt at mystification—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex uno disce
omnes</span></i>; but the story suggests an attitude of caution in
the case of other similar finds.</p>

<p class='c001' >I cannot discuss this thorny question here, and must
refer those interested in such subjects as the <i>Glain Nidr</i>
or ‘Adder Beads of the Druids,’ or again, the Breton
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ouef rouge du Serpent Marin</span></i>, to the exhaustive paper
by the late Mr. John Brent in the forty-fifth volume of
<cite>Archæologia</cite>.</p>

  <h2 id='ch12' class='c005'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />THE ENAMELLED VENETIAN GLASS OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_8 c006'     >In the fourteenth century, as we have seen, the
Venetian galleys brought glass ware to the ports
of England and the Netherlands. M. de Laborde
(<cite>Les Ducs de Bourgogne</cite>) found in the archives of Lille an
order for payment, signed by Duke Philip of Burgundy,
‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour seze voirres et une escuelle de voirre, des voirriers
que les galées de Venise ont avan apportez en nostre pays
de Flandres—quatre franc</span></i>.’ This is dated from Paris,
1394. Even after making every allowance for the larger
purchasing power of money in those days, the seventeen
vessels of glass bought by a royal prince for four francs
cannot have been of exceptional quality. Again, in the
year 1399, Richard <span class='fss'>II.</span>, shortly before his deposition,
granted permission to certain traders to sell, on the decks
of the Venetian galleys lately arrived in the port of
London, their cargo of small glass vessels and earthenware
plates (<cite>Calendar of State Papers—Venetian</cite>, 1899-1900).
Here again there is nothing to suggest any high
artistic value in the glass offered for sale.</p>

<p class='c001' >As we have seen, with the possible exception of two
goblets in the British Museum, there does not exist a
single example of glass of an earlier date than the
fifteenth century, which can definitely claim to be of
Venetian origin.</p>

<p class='c001' >The <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">quattro-cento</span></i> glass of Venice,<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c018'><sup>[144]</sup></a> for the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_193' id='Page_193'>193</a></span>
part decorated with enamel and gilding, may be conveniently
arranged in accordance with the nature of the
enamels that cover it.</p>

<p class='c001' >I will take first a class in which the enamel plays
but a subordinate part. The clear white glass, somewhat
thick and heavy compared with later examples, is often
ornamented with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appliqué</span></i> bosses of coloured glass; such
glass is sparingly decorated with opaque enamels, and
this decoration takes the form of little beads or studs, at
times combined with an imbricated pattern in gold. We
sometimes meet with large bowls on low feet (a form
of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">drageoir</span></i> or sweetmeat dish) which are so decorated.
There is, however, no finer example of this style of
ornament than the standing beaker with cover in the
British Museum (Slade, 362). The general outline and
the obliquely curved gadroons of this magnificent cup
were no doubt suggested by some piece of late Gothic
silver-plate. On the flat-headed knob that surmounts
the cover are the half obliterated remains of a coat of
arms, but otherwise the enamelling is confined to some
sparely applied studding and filleting. There is a
covered goblet of the same class in the Waddesdon
collection remarkable for an inscription in some South-Slavonic
dialect, scratched with a diamond on the foot.
The blue and purple bosses round the body of these
beakers partake somewhat of the nature of prunts.</p>

<p class='c001' >Another class of fifteenth-century enamelled glass
calls to mind in the manner of its decoration the contemporary
enamelled copper ware of Venice (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">émaux
peints</span></i>). Indeed, in some examples where the enamel is
spread over the whole field and subsequently decorated
with other colours, there is little to indicate that such
a vessel has a basis of glass rather than of metal.
This is the case with the beautiful goblet covered
with pale turquoise blue enamel in the Waddesdon Room
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_194' id='Page_194'>194</a></span>
in the British Museum. The decoration is given by an
elaborate imbrication of white, red, and gold; the well-drawn
male and female figures, in lozenge-shaped medallions,
closely resemble certain woodcuts in Venetian
books of the fifteenth century. If, as is probable, this
cup is not much later in date than the year 1450, we
have in it one of the earliest examples in glass of the
complete goblet or wine-glass form, with bowl, stem, and
foot.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c018'><sup>[145]</sup></a> The outline of the bowl should be noticed: the
double curve, <em>tending somewhat inwards</em> at the top, is
characteristic of these <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">quattro-cento</span></i> glasses; here again
the form is doubtless derived from silver-plate.</p>

<p class='c001' >These opaque solid enamels are, however, more frequently
applied here and there upon a basis of transparent
coloured glass. For the ground a deep cobalt blue was
most in favour, but a rich leafy green and other colours
also occur at times. The opaque enamels are laid on
thickly in masses; upon these again details are painted
by further touches of colour.</p>

<p class='c001' >Perhaps the most famous example of this class is the
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coppa Nuziale</span></i> in the Museo Civico at Venice (<a href='#p29'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXIX.</span></a>).
This cup, in outline somewhat like a Greek <i>crater</i>, with
simple massive foot and stem, is of deep blue glass;
it is some eight or nine inches in height. On one side
we have a procession of knights and ladies on horseback;
on the other side the company are seen bathing in an
open fountain. Between are medallions with male and
female heads—presumably the bride and bridegroom.
The costume would point rather to the first than to the
second half of the fifteenth century. There is not much
prominent colour apart from the green of the grass and
the trees; the horses and the flesh-tints are rendered
by white enamels, and gilding, of course, is freely used;
here and there we see a little pale blue enamel. This
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">coppa</span></i> is traditionally assigned to Angelo Berovieri, the
greatest name among the Venetian glass-workers of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_195' id='Page_195'>195</a></span>
fifteenth century. To him indeed the introduction, or at
least the perfection, of the process of enamelling on glass
is generally attributed.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>MARRIAGE CUP BY BEROVIERI<br />
<small>VENETIAN, FIFTEENTH CENTURY</small>
</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c001' >In the British Museum (Slade, 363) is another <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coppa
Nuziale</span></i>, on which the style of the decoration closely
follows that of the Berovieri cup. We have the same
deep blue ground and the same treatment of the solid
opaque enamels; the bowl, however, in this case is
cylindrical. On one side we see a Cupid seated on a
two-headed swan, conducting a triumphal car; on the
other, Venus enthroned in another car is preceded by a
figure—presumably Hymen—bearing a torch; in front
a centaur is grasping the hand of a man in full armour.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c018'><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >The bright green enamel by which on these cups the
grass and the conventional trees are rendered, is perhaps
the most characteristic colour of this <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">quattro-cento</span></i> ware.
Note also on the wide-spreading foot the manner in
which the gold is applied: in the use of this metal, if in
nothing else, the Venetians surpassed their Saracenic
predecessors. Here we have an early instance of gilding
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">semé</span></i> or broken up into minute irregular fragments.
The gold appears to be incorporated with the glass; it
must have been laid on at an early stage, for it lies
scattered in detached fragments, and this is undoubtedly
caused by the dragging of the glass, while still soft,
during the process of manufacture. This manner of
applying gold was used with great effect by the Venetians
during the finest period—before and after 1500. Notice
especially a little cup of thin white glass in the British
Museum, on which the decoration is confined to a
delicate powdering of gold of this nature.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of the application of enamels of this class to a deep
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_196' id='Page_196'>196</a></span>
green ground, there is no finer example than the standing
cup from the Debruge and Soltykoff collections (Slade,
361). This, too, is without doubt a <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coppa Nuziale</span></i>,
and in the heads in the two medallions we may again
recognise the bride and bridegroom. On a scroll by the
latter head we read, <span class='fss'>AMOR VOL FEE</span>—‘Love needs faith.’
The quaint head-dress of the woman calls to mind certain
figures in Carpaccio’s pictures of contemporary Venetian
life.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the enamelled cups of this class the technical
imperfections of the deep-coloured glass ground should
be noticed. This is seen above all in the irregular outline
of the margin. We have here a class of imperfection
of quite a different nature from the tendency to collapse
so often seen in large pieces of Saracenic glass. In the
case of the Venetian glass the unevenness appears to arise
from the imperfect fluidity of the metal when in the hands
of the blower.</p>

<p class='c001' >The date of this enamelled glass is fairly well fixed
by the style in which the figure subjects are treated.
The processions—the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">trionfi</span></i>—are but rudely executed
reproductions of those found on fifteenth-century marriage
coffers, the heads in the medallions we meet with again
on the contemporary mezza-majolica. Both may be seen
in the woodcuts of the earliest printed books. We find
the source of the gadroons and imbricated patterns in
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">repoussé</span></i> forms given by the Venetians to their
enamelled copper-ware.</p>

<p class='c001' >There is somewhat more difficulty in determining the
date of another class of Venetian enamelled glass. I
refer to that on which the opaque enamels are painted
with a brush upon a ground of thin colourless glass. In
this decoration, especially in the conventional foliage, the
drag of the brush loaded with the thin, somewhat intractable
pigment, may often be clearly traced. There
are some early examples of these ‘painted’ enamels
which we may regard as the prototypes of a style of
decoration on glass which soon obtained almost a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>197</a></span>
monopoly among enamelled wares. We see the same
technique and the same opaque colours on the French
glass of the sixteenth century, and the faults are exaggerated
and the palette even heavier in the case of the
German glass of a still later time. We must seek the
origin of this school in the Italian painters on majolica;
on the other hand, in the eighteenth century the methods
of the enamellers on glass no doubt influenced the decorators
of porcelain both in Germany and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c001' >And here I may say that certain important technical
difficulties, that must always have hampered the use of
true transparent enamels on glass, have scarcely received
the attention that they deserve. I mean the relations of
the enamels, as regards the softening-point and rate of
contraction on cooling, to the ground on which they rest.
The question here is very similar to that which presents
itself in the case of porcelain. Our present problem is,
however, somewhat simpler, for with the latter material
we have not only to consider the relation of the enamels
to the glaze on which they lie (this takes, indeed, the place
of our glass ground), but in addition the relation of the
glaze itself to the porcelain body beneath must not be
neglected.</p>

<p class='c001' >The first condition for the successful application of
an enamel is that it should be more fusible than the
glass to which it is applied; not only that, but at the
temperature at which the enamel fuses, the glass must
still maintain its rigidity, otherwise the vessel on coming
from the enameller’s stove will not preserve its original
symmetry. It has been already suggested that the partial
collapse so often observed in the large Cairene lamps
may probably be explained in this way.</p>

<p class='c001' >On the other hand, if the surface of the glass is not
to some degree softened, there will be no intimate connection
between it and the enamel, and the latter will
be likely to scale off before long. This tendency will be
increased if there is much difference in the rate or
amount of contraction between the two materials. Difficulties
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>198</a></span>
of this kind long hindered the employment of
certain fluxes and colours—that of cobalt, for instance,
combined with a transparent flux. Such obstacles may,
however, be surmounted in a measure, and the process
simplified by employing (in place of a transparent lead
flux) an opaque white, stanniferous enamel merely
stained, in cases only externally, by a little colouring
material. This apparently was the plan universally
adopted by the Venetians in the fifteenth century, and
it is here that their experience of the use of a similar
enamel on copper may have served them.</p>

<p class='c001' >One cannot but marvel at the technical dexterity so
early acquired, and, alas! so soon lost by the Saracens,
in the application of enamels to glass. The means by
which they avoided the use of a lead flux in the case
of their famous translucent blue, is above all worthy of
admiration (see above, <a href='#ch10'>Chapter <span class='fss'>X.</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c001' >Certain defects which we note in the glass to which
the Venetians applied their thick enamels may have been
inseparably bound up with the use of these same enamels,
and the impossibility of overcoming these defects may
have been one of the causes of their abandonment and of
the general adoption in their place of the painted decoration—mere
thin skins of colour—which they were now
able to apply to their white <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>, the typical glass
of Venice. After the commencement of the sixteenth
century, indeed, the use of the solid enamels was almost
confined to beadings and subsidiary ornament sparingly
applied.</p>

<p class='c001' >To return after this long digression to our class of
thinly painted enamels. We find that the use of these
painted colours came in at quite an early date. I will
take as typical examples a pair of goblets or wine-glasses
in the British Museum, one from the Slade collection
(No. 391), the other presented by the late Sir A. W.
Franks. These are both conical cups of simple outline,
of which the bowl passes directly into the spreading foot.
The edge of this foot is turned over to form a sort of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_199' id='Page_199'>199</a></span>
ring on the upper margin. In fact, these goblets may
be taken as representatives of one of the earliest types
of that long series of wine-glasses that we shall come
across again and again in later days. On the first of
these cups we see two figures on horseback, one waving
a banner and the other holding a flag; the costume
points to the end of the fifteenth century. This is a
detail of some importance, for as a rule the decoration
of this class of enamelled glass is confined to foliage,
scrolls, and classically treated figures of sirens or satyrs.</p>

<p class='c001' >Almost identical in shape, and decorated in a similar
manner, is a little goblet, or rather fragment of a goblet,
lately dug up in the Piazza of St. Mark at Venice during
the excavations for the foundations of the new Campanile.
(<a href='#p30'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXX.</span></a> 2). This little glass, between four and five
inches in height, is of a thinnish clear metal, decorated
with scrolls of a somewhat Gothic character, indicated
by lines of opaque white; the other enamels are green,
an opaque red, a rich yellow, and a deep as well as a
turquoise blue, the latter laid on thickly. This goblet
may perhaps be referred to the middle of the fifteenth
century.</p>

<p class='c001' >A still finer example of these ‘painted’ enamels is to
be found in a very beautiful ewer now in the Louvre.
The colours are laid on with a brush as in the previous
specimens, but as we often find in later examples—and
this applies equally to the French and German enamelled
glass—the opaque red is here replaced by a poor brown.
Within a large medallion is seen a herald riding on a
griffin; the ground is covered by scale patterns and
scrolls of many colours.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_8 c006'     >The history of modern glass begins, as I have
said, with the famous Venetian <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> of the
sixteenth century. Many other varieties were
made at this time, but it was the absolutely colourless
and transparent glass, capable of being blown to extreme
thinness and then worked into every variety of form,
that above all established the European reputation of
the Murano glass-workers. Before long, in nearly every
country of Western Europe, the old methods of working
were falling into disuse; and by the aid of skilled workmen
who were tempted away from Murano, or, failing
that, were hired from the rival glass furnaces of L’Altare,
the attempt was made to imitate this clear white glass of
Venice.</p>

<p class='c001' >We have, then, in this <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> the typical glass of
Venice, and here more than in any other group, whether
of earlier or of later date, we find a family of glass of
which the artistic merit depends directly upon the skill
of the glass-blower, rather than on that of the enameller
or engraver. In the simpler and earlier specimens, an
undeniable charm is derived from the extreme tenuity
of the material—there is an evanescent and almost
ghostly air about the ‘diaphanous, pellucid, dainty body’<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c018'><sup>[147]</sup></a>
of not a few of these glasses. Although entirely free
from any positive colour, there is often a certain tendency
to greyness in the metal, and this is increased to a misty
cloudiness when the surface has been attacked by atmospheric
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_201' id='Page_201'>201</a></span>
influence, as is not unfrequently the case with
glasses that have been long exposed to our damp English
climate.</p>

</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c001' >There is little change or development to be observed
in the glass of this character made at Murano during the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, nor is it always safe
to regard contorted shapes and elaborate decorations
as necessarily a sign of a late origin. This caution is
confirmed by an often quoted passage from Sabellico,
the learned librarian of St. Mark’s and historian of
Venice; it is from a Latin work, <cite>De Situ Venetæ
Urbis</cite>, written about 1495. We can form from it some
idea of the wonderful variety of the outturn from the
Murano glass-works at that time, and of the elaborate
shapes that were already given to the vessels. When
we pass, says Sabellico, from Venice to the suburb of
Murano, we are struck by the grandeur and size of the
buildings; it appears from afar as a city, extending for
a mile in length. The island owes its chief renown to its
glass-works. It was a famous discovery to make glass
that should vie with crystal in clearness. Since then
the nimble wit of the workmen and the never-resting
care to find something new have led them to apply
to the material a thousand various colours and shapes
without number. Hence the <i>calices</i>, the flasks, the
<i>canthari</i>, the ewers, the <i>candelabra</i>, the animals of every
race, the horns, the beads (<i>segmenta</i>), the bracelets, etc.
etc. So far Sabellico—the good man is, I am afraid, more
concerned with his latinity than with the matter in hand:
but this is a weakness that he shares with more than
one writer of this time. He goes on to speak of the
‘Murrhine vases’ made at Murano, of which the only
fault is their cheapness; all these marvels had the
Venetian galleys brought before the eyes of the nations,
so that, wondrous to say, by familiarity they had become
as things base and common.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the means adopted by the Venetians to adorn their
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> we are at times taken back to Roman methods.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_202' id='Page_202'>202</a></span>
The handles, often of blue glass, and the stringings and
frillings that surround the body are applied hastily but
skilfully by the light hand of the workman. This kind
of ornament reached its completest development in the
tall beakers and vases with handles that took the form
of wing-like excrescences. These ‘winged beakers’ were
afterwards copied and the forms exaggerated in Germany
and in the Netherlands, where they were held to be
especially characteristic of the now fashionable glass of
Venice.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is certainly remarkable how little this Muranese
glass as a whole reflects the glorious Venetian art of the
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cinquecento</span></i>. Apart from some of the earlier enamelled
and gilt examples and from the simpler forms of the pure
thin <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>, we can find among it little that is quite
satisfactory from an artistic point of view. Much even
of the sixteenth-century glass is merely fantastic, and
appeals only to childish tastes. The bulk of it was probably
made for foreign markets, for the dull northern
barbarian, whose attention had to be caught by something
new and extravagant.</p>

<p class='c001' >Little heed is paid to this more elaborately decorated
glass by the great contemporary painters. In fact, I can
find no example of it in their works. When glass is
introduced, it is invariably of the simplest description.
In the big altar-pieces of Giovanni Bellini, of Cima, or of
Carpaccio, the glass lamps that hang from the roof are
in the form of little conical cups of plain outline. Amid
all the elaborate <i>staffage</i> of Crivelli’s pictures, the lily on
the table or ledge beside the Virgin stands in a little
cylindrical beaker of glass, for all the world like a modern
tumbler.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c018'><sup>[148]</sup></a> So in the next century we may search in vain
in the pictures of Titian or of Veronese for elaborate
examples of Venetian glass. In the banquet scenes of
the latter painter, the wine indeed is served from graceful
decanters with tall necks and globular bodies, and is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_203' id='Page_203'>203</a></span>
drunk from tazza-shaped goblets of glass,<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c018'><sup>[149]</sup></a> but on the
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">credenza</span></i> or buffet at the side, the gold and silver plate is
never relieved by examples of our material.</p>

<p class='c001' >A curious account of a banquet given at Mantua, on
the occasion of the marriage of the Marquis, is quoted
by Mr. Nesbitt from a contemporary writer. There was,
we are told, on this occasion such a display of ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">diversi
bicchieri, carrafe, e giarre ed altri bellissimi vasi di cristallo
di Venezia, che credo vi fussero concorse tutte le
botteghe di Morano!</span></i>’ And there was need of this store,
he adds, seeing that after they had drunk, the guests
proceeded to break the glasses they held in their hands
‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">per segno di grande allegrezza</span></i>.’<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c018'><sup>[150]</sup></a> We are reminded of
the feast described by Joinville, though in that case the
glasses were swept off the table by the well-aimed Bible
of one of the guests (see p. <a href='#Page_136'>136</a>).</p>

<p class='c019' >I shall now have to pass in rapid review the principal
varieties and applications of the glass made at Murano
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p class='c001' >The Frosted or Crackle Glass is perhaps the simplest
modification of the pure <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>. To produce this, the
<i>paraison</i> is plunged rapidly into cold water, and after
reheating to the necessary degree, but not beyond, it is
worked into the desired form. A similar effect is at
times produced by rolling the molten <i>paraison</i> upon
fragments of crushed glass. I have spoken in the introductory
chapter of certain rare cases where a minute
fissuring has been set up in the substance of the glass.
This true crackle is probably in all cases the result of a
subsequent structural change.</p>

<p class='c001' ><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Latticinio</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lattisuol</span></i>, or <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lattimo</span></i> are names given
by the Venetians to a milk-white opaque glass. White
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_204' id='Page_204'>204</a></span>
enamels were freely used in the fifteenth century, but the
earliest known specimen of Venetian glass, the whole
body of which is rendered opaque by the presence of
oxide of tin (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">calcina di stagno</span></i>)—the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetro bianco di
smalto</span></i> of the early writers<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c018'><sup>[151]</sup></a>—can hardly be older than
the beginning of the next century.</p>

<p class='c001' >The spherical vase (Slade, 402) formerly in the possession
of the Marquis D’Azeglio, is an exceptionally
beautiful example of this milk-white glass (<a href='#p32'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXXII.</span></a>).
The gilt scrolls harmonise well with the slightly warmish
ground, and were it not for the rudely executed mermaids
on either side, an Eastern origin might well have been
sought for this quite exceptional piece; in fact, I do not
know of any other specimen of undoubted Venetian glass
so distinctly Persian in character.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the Museo Civico at Venice is a flask (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</span></i> 1530)
of this <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">lattimo</span></i> glass, about five inches in height, decorated
in blue, with allegorical subjects. Although somewhat
rudely executed, the painting is masterly in style,
and may be compared to that on the best contemporary
majolica (<a href='#p33'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXXIII.</span></a>). At a first glance this little vase
might be taken for an example of Medici porcelain, and
indeed we must bear in mind that all through the sixteenth
century attempts were being made in Venice to
imitate the porcelain of the Far East, more especially
the plain white and the blue and white wares which were
already arriving at Venice in considerable quantity.</p>

<p class='c001' >This <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">lattimo</span></i> glass came much into favour for a second
time early in the eighteenth century; it was at that time
often decorated in colours in a pseudo-Japanese style.
This later milk-white glass is once more closely associated
with the attempts then again made at Venice, as
in so many other countries, to imitate the porcelain of
China and Japan. This had indeed, before the end of
the previous century, been in a measure accomplished
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_205' id='Page_205'>205</a></span>
in France by means of a soft paste, in the composition
of which a glass-like frit played an important part. At
a still later time this <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">lattimo</span></i> glass was even painted in
monochrome, in imitation of our early printed Worcester
porcelain!</p>

<small>VENETIAN, EARLY SIXTEENTH CENTURY</small>
</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c001' >Closely based upon this <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">latticinio</span></i>—for the threads in
a vast majority of cases are of an opaque white—is the
famous <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vetro di Trina</span></i> or lace-glass. At the beginning
of the last century the art of making this net-work
decoration appears to have almost died out, but in the
thirties and forties it was revived by Domenico Bussolin,
and when later on more interest began to be taken in the
Murano glass, it was to this <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetro a reticelli</span></i> that at first
most attention was given. The details of the manufacture
were described and illustrated by the well-known
director of the Choisy glass-works, M. Bontemps (<cite>Exposé
des moyens employés pour la fabrication des verres
filigranes</cite>, 1845).</p>

<p class='c001' >There is, however, a simpler and perhaps easier
application of these bands of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">lattimo</span></i>, in which they are
applied in a series of festoons to the surface. In this
case the opaque white enamel appears to have been laid
on to the <i>paraison</i> at an early stage and dragged into
crescent-shaped waves, so as to resemble closely the
decoration of the little flasks of coloured glass from
Egyptian and early Greek tombs—to those later examples
more especially, from Rhodes and Cyprus, on which the
colours are only applied to the surface (p. <a href='#Page_37'>37</a>), the resemblance
in technique is very close. There are many
interesting specimens of this festooned <i>latticinio</i> in the
British Museum. In the case of the little <i>biberon</i> (Slade,
No. 628) the festoons are worked into a palm pattern,
identical with that often found on the little primitive
vases.</p>

<p class='c001' >I shall not attempt to follow in detail the manner of
preparation of the true <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetro di trina</span></i>,—suffice to say that
it is built up of a number of juxtaposed rods; these
rods are arranged perpendicularly, side by side, so as to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_206' id='Page_206'>206</a></span>
form a hollow cylinder, and into the midst a small vesicle
of molten glass is inserted; to this the rods adhere, and
the whole mass is then worked into the desired form.
The rods themselves—they are similar to the <i>canne</i>
supplied to the <i>suppialume</i> workers (p. <a href='#Page_187'>187</a>)—may be either
of opaque or clear glass, or they may be formed of
elaborate combinations of the two (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">canelle a ritorto o
merlate</span></i>); the most complicated patterns are thus obtained.
When two series of these rods are arranged to cross one
another at an angle, we get a reticulated pattern, and
within the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">reticelli</span></i> thus formed a bubble of air may be
caught up. There is, indeed, little opportunity for finding
in this kind of work any free play for the decorative
feeling of the artist, and the result of all these ingenious
combinations of crossings and interlacings is only too
often to give a tame and machine-made air to the finished
vase or tazza.</p>

<p class='c001' >The Opalised Glass, the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Calcedonio</span></i><a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c018'><sup>[152]</sup></a> of the Venetians,
is obtained by adding the same materials as in the case
of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">latticinio</span></i>, but in very small proportions: it stands
to the latter as weak milk and water to pure milk. In
practice, I believe, the opalescence is often given by the
addition of phosphate of lime in the form of bone-ash,
sometimes, perhaps, by arsenious acid.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c018'><sup>[153]</sup></a> Pale blue by
reflected light, it takes various orange and yellow tints
when the light is transmitted through it. Such a vessel
as the cylindrical goblet and cover of thick <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">calcedonio</span></i> in
the Waddesdon Room at the British Museum, with a
design in high relief representing the Triumph of
Neptune, must have been cast in a mould.</p>

<p class='c001' >We now come to certain varieties of glass which were
much admired at one time, but are now little in favour.
The aim, it would seem, in this class, as in the case of
the old Roman prototype, was to imitate various kinds
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_207' id='Page_207'>207</a></span>
of precious stones and marbles. But the Venetians
showed here little of the restraint of their classical predecessors,
so that on the whole the colours, where not
crude, are huddled together in muddy compounds.</p>

<p class='c001' >An opaque red glass resembling jasper was probably
known at Murano as early as the fourteenth century. In
an inventory of the property of the Duke of Anjou (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</span></i>
1360) there is mention of a ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pichier de voirre vermeil
semblable a Jaspe</span></i>.’ So in the next century, Charles the
Bold possessed ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ung hanap de Jaspe garni d’or, à
œuvre de Venise</span></i>’—to judge from the expression used
this beaker was also of glass.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c018'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Already in a Milanese manuscript of 1443 (described
below) there is a formula given for making <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">schmelz</span></i> by
means of a mixture of certain salts of silver, iron, and
copper, and before the end of the century we have
Sabellico’s complaint that the modern murrhine glass
was becoming far too common (see page 201); so that, on
the whole, this family of marbled glass is, perhaps, as old
as any other Venetian glass of which we have specimens.
The examples, however, that have survived appear to be
mostly of a somewhat later date. We find imitations of
both classes of the Roman <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">millefiori</span></i>—the tints, however,
are generally crudely matched—and especially several
varieties of marbled glass with contorted veins of many
colours. The schmelz <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</span></i> of the Venetians
(the German name would seem to point to a northern
origin) is an irregularly veined and mottled mass, a
somewhat unpleasant combination of bluish-green and
purple tints, calling to mind certain kinds of slag—indeed
it may have originally been made in imitation of
some such substance. There are a few exceptionally fine
early examples of this schmelz at South Kensington.
Notice above all the spherical vase from the Castellani
collection with <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cinquecento</span></i> mountings and serpent handles
of copper gilt; the greenish-yellow and pale blue tints
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_208' id='Page_208'>208</a></span>
are in this case harmoniously blended. To judge from
the form of the bowl and stem, the cup of finely marbled
schmelz at Hertford House cannot be dated much later
than 1500. In this case, and probably in others also,
the marblings are only on the surface; the interior is
of a uniform greyish-green colour.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of scarcely less importance is the splashed ware for
which we can again find a Roman if not an Egyptian
prototype. The splashes of enamel of various colours
must have been scattered over the <i>paraison</i> at an early
stage, for they have had to follow the changes of form
given to the surface in the shaping of the vessel: we see
them stretched out at the neck on the little burette in the
Slade collection (No. 783). This splashed glass was much
admired by the French and successfully imitated by them.</p>

<p class='c001' >Something should be said of the painted Venetian
glass of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. I
say ‘painted,’ for such it is in general effect, although the
pigments have probably in most cases been subjected to
some kind of firing. The very poverty and dulness of the
colours are indeed a proof of this; the artist’s palette has
been subjected to the exigencies of the enameller’s muffle.
We find landscapes with classical figures and <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">amorini</span></i>
painted on the lower surface of bowls and rondelles
(<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">tondi</span></i>). In the Dutuit collection, now housed in the
Petit Palais at Paris, is a circular dish some fifteen inches
in diameter, painted on the under surface, so as to be
viewed through the glass; the subject, a dance of cupids,
is treated in an exceptionally fine style and can scarcely
be later than the middle of the sixteenth century. In
many cases these designs have been added to Venetian
glass by non-Venetian, sometimes by northern hands.
This kind of painting or enamelling is, however, very
subject to injury by use, and doubtless for this reason
it is sometimes protected by a second sheet of glass.
We have in such painted dishes a variety of the so-called
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre églomisé</span></i> to which reference has already more than
once been made.</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_209' id='Page_209'>209</a></span>
The Venetians at times drew designs on their glass
with a diamond. There are some examples of this in a
good <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cinquecento</span></i> style in the Slade collection; but this
work was confined to the pure scratched line, and even
shading was not much used. It was not till the
eighteenth century that they began to copy the later
German methods of deep engraving and cutting with the
wheel.</p>

<p class='c001' >The British Museum has lately acquired a square
plaque of clear thick glass; at the back, in deep intaglio,
is the portrait of a Doge, who, on the ground of the letters
A. G. on either side of the head, may be identified with
Andrea Gritti (1523-1538).<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c018'><sup>[155]</sup></a> The late M. Piot has
extracted from a fifteenth-century treatise on architecture
by Antonio Averlini a dialogue between two artists upon
some curious applications of glass. We hear of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallino</span></i>
plaques with figures carved on the lower surface, so as
apparently to stand out in relief—a description which
would apply well enough to this <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">piastra</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c019' >There is no more troubled story in the history of
glass-making than that of the manufacture of <span class='sc'>Mirrors</span> at
Murano from the fourteenth to the eighteenth century.
We have seen in the early days, when these mirrors were
backed with lead (p. <a href='#Page_138'>138</a>), that the Germans had already
become experts in this department. More than once in
the Venetian archives there are references to the secret
methods of these <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Todeschi</span></i>. In a petition of 1503 there
is mention of a plan for making good and perfect mirrors,
a precious secret unknown except to certain Germans. It
is impossible to resist the suspicion that there is here a
reference to the cylinder process, which, as we have seen,
was already known to Theophilus (p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>); by this process
it would have been possible to produce a fairly large
and comparatively flat sheet of glass. The Venetians,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_210' id='Page_210'>210</a></span>
on the other hand, probably continued to a late period
to use the old method of ‘spinning’ or ‘flashing.’<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c018'><sup>[156]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >It was only after the middle of the sixteenth century
that the mirror-makers, the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">specchiai</span></i>, formed themselves
into a separate corporation; but in this guild were included,
it would seem, the makers of the so-called mirrors
of steel.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c018'><sup>[157]</sup></a> Thus we find that in 1574, one Francesco
Zamberlan, who only two years before had taken out a
patent for his ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">specchi d’acciaio</span></i>,’ was admitted to the
new guild on the ground of his special knowledge. Those
engaged in the polishing—the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">lustratura</span></i> and <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">spianatura</span></i>—of
both materials, glass and metal, were also members
of the guild.</p>

<p class='c001' >For us the interest in these mirrors lies rather in the
framing. We find the new corporation early engaged in
quarrels with the painters and with the workers in tarsia,
mother-of-pearl, and coral (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">i miniatori</span></i>, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">i marangoni</span></i>,
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">e muschieri</span></i>), who found employment in decorating the
frames.</p>

<p class='c001' >For a time, no doubt, the Venetian mirrors held their
own, but before the end of the seventeenth century the
French, thanks to the energy of Colbert, had not only
learned all their secrets, but by an entirely new method—namely
by a process of casting or founding, and subsequent
rolling and polishing of the glass plates—were
able to meet the demand for the large mirrors that were
now regarded as indispensable in a Louis-Quatorze
salon. But these ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">glaces de St. Gobain</span></i>’ are of an entirely
different nature from the exquisitely framed little <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">lustri</span></i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_211' id='Page_211'>211</a></span>
with which we are now concerned. Unfortunately, as far
as I know, there are no characteristic specimens of these
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cinquecento</span></i> mirrors—at least of those in which glass
forms an important element in the frame as well—in
any of our public collections. For fine examples of such
work we must go to the Louvre or the Hôtel de Cluny.
It will be noticed that the margin of the glass is invariably
bevelled, thus forming a transition to the elaborate
framing. These <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cinquecento</span></i> Italian mirrors were extensively
copied, and this at an early date, both in France
and at Nuremberg.</p>

<p class='c001' >In spite of the heroic efforts made by the authorities
in the late seventeenth and in the following century to
introduce the new methods of working glass at Murano,
the Venetians failed to maintain their position. It was
only in the more conservative Eastern markets that the
demand for their mirrors was kept up; even to-day,
in Syria or in Persia, these Italian glasses may not
unfrequently be seen in private houses and even in
mosques.</p>

<p class='c001' >Another characteristic application of the glass of
Murano was to the elaborate chandeliers that formed so
important a part in the decoration of the reception-rooms
of a Venetian palace in the seventeenth century. In
these the metal framework is completely hidden by a
thick foliage, as it were, of glass—frequently of the
opalescent <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">calcedonio</span></i>—amid which the tall wax candles
spring up here and there. M. Gerspach extols the
decorative value of these chandeliers:—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le soir, le lustre
de Venise allumé est un rayonnement harmonieux sans
reflets discordants; le jour, stalactite ciselée, il égaye
l’appartement comme une note claire et joyeuse</span></i>’ (<cite>La
Verrerie</cite>, p. 173).</p>

<p class='c001' >In the eighteenth century the contorted forms, imitating
leaves and flowers, were replaced by pendent discs of
colourless crystal, cut, polished, and often facetted. Of
these later chandeliers there is a splendid series, whether
of Venetian origin or not I do not know, at Hertford
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_212' id='Page_212'>212</a></span>
House. Such chandeliers were known in England in
the eighteenth century as ‘lustres.’<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c018'><sup>[158]</sup></a> They are above all
numerous in German palaces, and most of the glass is
probably of German or Flemish origin. But of the
earlier type I cannot find a single example in any of our
public museums.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c018'><sup>[159]</sup></a> The manufacture, however, has been
revived at Murano, and chandeliers of this class, with no
claims to antiquity, may often be seen in private houses
both at home and abroad. The spread of electric lighting
has given a stimulus to work of this kind, for the corolla-shaped
shades that so often accompany our incandescent
lamps have, in most cases, obviously been modelled upon
the glass of the old Venetian chandeliers.</p>

<p class='c001' >The glass-workers of Murano were a conservative
body; their work was based upon secret processes and
rule-of-thumb formulas. The elaborate division into
different <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">arti</span></i> or corporations, each governed by its
separate <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">mariegola</span></i>, made it excessively difficult to introduce
any radical changes into the methods of work.
It is quite pathetic to observe the efforts of the comparatively
enlightened governing body, the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">conservatori alle
arti</span></i>, who in the last years of the republic attempted to
introduce the new processes that were revolutionising the
glass industry in the north of Europe. We find reports
signed by great names—Morosini and others—recommending
the introduction of English machinery, and
drawing up plans for the cultivation of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Salsola soda</span></i>
on the islands of the lagoons. Little attention apparently
was given to the artistic side by these reformers. One
of the last names in the long list of the Murano glass-makers
is that of Giuseppe Briati, famous for the purity
of his <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>; he excelled, too, in the designing and
the execution of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetro di trina</span></i>, and Lazari declares
that much of the ‘lace glass’ in our collections attributed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_213' id='Page_213'>213</a></span>
to the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cinquecento</span></i> belongs rather to him or to his school.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c018'><sup>[160]</sup></a>
Briati in 1739 was allowed to set up a furnace in Venice
itself for the preparation of his <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>, the first time for
more than four hundred years that such a permission had
been granted. It is of this Briati that we are told that
his glass found a place on the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">credenza</span></i> or buffet at the
public banquets of the Doge, beside the gold and silver
plate. This would appear to have been an innovation
(see above, p. <a href='#Page_203'>203</a>) introduced with the special aim of
encouraging the declining industry. An exception was
again made in favour of one Giorgio Barbaria, who so
late as 1790, in the parish of the Gesuiti, manufactured
bottles by a new English method. But as a French writer
somewhat naïvely puts it—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ce genre ne prête guère à la
fantaisie</span></i>.’</p>

<p class='c001' >Before this time the Venetians had yielded to the new
fashion of the day, and were making cut and engraved
glass more or less after German or Bohemian models.
Of this class were the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">trionfi di tavola</span></i>—trophies of
glass for the decoration of the dinner-table—as well as
the gigantic chandeliers known as ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">ciocche</span></i>.’ To such
productions the artistic work of the time appears to have
been confined. Of the first there is a fine specimen from
the Casa Morosini set out in the centre of one of the
rooms in the Museo Civico at Venice. I have already
mentioned the chandeliers of cut glass. They played an
important part in a <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">rococo</span></i> interior.</p>

<p class='c001' >After the occupation of Venice by the French in 1797,
the Directory attempted unsuccessfully to transplant the
manufacture of beads (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marguerites</span></i>) to Paris. It is
significant that they regarded this as the most important
part of the glass industry. The corporations or <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">arti</span></i>
were finally abolished in 1806.</p>

<p class='c001' >During the ensuing thirty years the manufacture of
glass was at the lowest ebb. There was, however, a first
revival about 1838, which is associated with the name of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_214' id='Page_214'>214</a></span>
Bussolin. But it was the energy and skill of a lawyer
from Vicenza, Antonio Salviati, with the financial assistance
of certain English enthusiasts for the art, Sir Henry
Layard and Sir William Drake, in the first place, that led,
not long after the middle of the century, to the furnaces
of Murano again turning out something beyond window-glass
and beads.</p>

<p class='c019' >From the technical side Venetian glass belongs essentially
to the Mediterranean family—the art was possibly
learned in the first instance from the Byzantine Greeks.
But it is probably as a consequence of their intercourse
with the coast of Syria, the old home of glass,
that the Venetians acquired at so early a date a pre-eminent
position as glass-workers. Like that of their
predecessors, theirs was essentially a soda glass. What
distinguished it was, above all, its total freedom from
colour; the Venetians were the first, at least since Roman
times, to make an absolutely clear white glass. This
result they obtained not only by care in the selection of
their materials, especially in the source of the silica, but
also by an early mastery of the use of manganese, ‘the
glass-maker’s soap.’ The Venetian glass excelled again
in its working qualities, in the extreme ductility which it
maintained through a wide range of temperature. This
property was in a measure due to the large quantity of
alkali which entered into its composition. On the other
hand, this excess of soda has led at times to a rapid
tarnishing of the surface, visible above all in our damp
climate.</p>

<p class='c001' >But it is to the works of the contemporary Italian
writers that we had better turn for information on these
practical points. These are of two classes:—1st, Works
of some literary pretension which contain chapters on the
glass of Murano for the information of the general public.
2nd, Technical treatises, consisting for the most part of
formulas for the use of the glass-maker. To the first
class belong Fioravanti’s remarks on mirrors, which we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_215' id='Page_215'>215</a></span>
have already quoted. Biringuccio, the Sienese, in his
treatise on <cite>les arts du feu</cite> (<cite>De la Pirotechnia</cite>, Venice,
1540), has a chapter on glass (Bk. <span class='fss'>II.</span> cap. xiii.). He tells
us that the Venetians made glass from the ashes of <i>chali</i>,
an herb that grows in Syria and also near Magalone, in
the south of France (the lagoons of Maguelonne, near
Cette). In the place of this <i>chali</i> the ashes of fern or of
the mysterious <i>duznea</i> may be used. One part of the
lixiviated ash is mixed with two of the <i>cogoli</i>, the clear
white pebbles found in the bed of certain streams. To
these materials a small amount of manganese is added,
and the whole melted in a reverberatory furnace to
form a substance known as <i>fritta</i>, already a kind of
glass, but ‘<i>mal purgata</i>.’ The glass furnace is then described
in some detail: it is made to hold eight crucibles
(<i>conconi</i>), each three-quarters of a <i>braccio</i> (say fifteen
inches) in height. These <i>conconi</i> are made with <i>terra di
Valencia</i>, and are first well dried and annealed over the
fritting-hearth. We are told how, after melting in these
pots, the viscous substance is collected at the end of a
hollow rod of iron, turned and returned upon the marver
to unite the mass together, and then by blowing down
the tube extended to form a vesicle. This ‘<i>vescicha</i>’ is now
whirled round the head of the workman to lengthen it,
or it may be pressed into a mould of bronze (‘<i>in un cavo di
bronzo</i>’). It is now transferred to another rod of iron
(the <i>pontella</i>, though the word is not used), worked up in
various ways, and cut with shears. The handles and feet
are added, and the vessel may be decorated by enamelling
or otherwise.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c018'><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' ><cite>La Piazza Universale di tutte le professioni del
Mondo</cite>, by Tommaso Garzoni of Bagnacavallo, was, to
judge from the numerous editions issued, a very popular
work in its day. The copy before me, not by any means the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_216' id='Page_216'>216</a></span>
first edition, is dated Venice, 1585. It contains a chapter
entitled ‘<cite>De Vetrari, o Biccherari, Occhialari e Fenestrari</cite>.’
The superiority of the glass of Murano, ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">luogo
amenissimo e delitiosissimo presso a Venetia</span></i>,’ he attributes
to the saltness of the water, to the absence of dust,
so detrimental to the work, and to the abundant supply
of wood which gives a most beautiful and clear flame.
Besides, it is only at Murano that they know how to
prepare the soda with which the beautiful <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> is
made. That made from the herb <i>ugnea</i> (cf. the <i>duznea</i>
of Biringuccio) or from fern, produces a yellow and
brittle glass,—the inferiority of the potash glass is here
indirectly indicated. Among the long list of the vessels
made at Murano we find <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">zuccarini a reticelli</span></i> or <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">a
ritortoli</span></i>, interesting as an early mention of lace glass.
The word <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">zuccarino</span></i>, literally a basin for sweets, is used
as a general name for covered bowls or dishes. We then
have the account (already quoted) of the preparation of
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">latticinio</span></i>, and also of a glass made up of fragments of
<i>canne</i> of various colours, a kind of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">millefiori</span></i>, in fact.
There is, he tells us, nothing imaginable in the world
that these Muranese cannot make with glass—castles
even with towers, bastions, walls, and cannon. ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Come
nell’ Ascensa di Venetia talvolta s’ è vista</span></i>,’ he continues.
This refers, I think, to the display of masterpieces of
glass in the procession on Ascension Day.</p>

<p class='c001' >Garzoni, we must remember, is in this book in the
first place concerned with the various trades and professions
of his time, and he takes us next to the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">occhiolari</span></i>,
the makers of spectacles, who ply their trade in the
Merceria, and finally to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Finestrari</span></i> or <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vetriari</span></i>, who
with marvellous rapidity fit into frames of lead ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">certi
occhi di vetro</span></i>’ made at Murano. We see from this that
the old bull’s-eye glass was still in general use.</p>

<p class='c001' >I must now, in conclusion, say something of the other
class of writers, those who, without any literary pretensions,
claim to disclose the secret processes and formulas
of the glass-workers. These men are the successors of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_217' id='Page_217'>217</a></span>
Theophilus and of the compilers of the early alchemistic
treatises of which I have spoken in a previous chapter.
It is noticeable that not one of these men, as far as
we know, was a Venetian; indeed in every case, if
the writer is not a Florentine himself, it is from
Florentine libraries and archives that his works have
been extracted.</p>

<p class='c001' >Cennini was essentially a writer of this class, but in
his <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trattato della Pittura</span></i> there are only a few casual
references to glass. The three little treatises found by
Gaetano Milanesi in the Florentine archives, and published
by him in 1864, are chiefly concerned with the
preparation of glass for mosaics. They may probably be
attributed to the first half of the fifteenth century, and
we thus have in the recipes which fill these books the
earliest documentary evidence for the composition of
Venetian glass. I will quote from the first of these little
works a section (xxiii.) which treats of ‘the placing of
glass on the surface of glass.’ The writer, it should be
noted, is concerned with the preparation of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">piastre</span></i>
or slabs from which were cut the little cubes for mosaic
work; this question of the various ways in which a leaf
of gold may be included between two sheets of glass
is one which has already interested us.</p>

<p class='c001' >‘♃ The glass to be about as thin as an eye-glass. Cut
the leaves of the gold to the length of the glass, and
put the gold upon the glass with white of egg; then place
above this gold the other upper glass, and dry the whole.
Then put them in the small ovens (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">fornelli</span></i>), and let them
be on a level so as not to slope, in order that the glass
may not run. When they have become red-hot, load
them with an iron so that they may grow together and
unite. Then place them over the arch of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">fornacetta</span></i>
(probably the fritting-oven), and let them cool little by
little.’</p>

<p class='c001' >The next section treats of the preparation of <i>lattimo
bianco</i> by calcining four parts of tin and two parts of
lead, and then mixing the resulting powder with ten parts
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_218' id='Page_218'>218</a></span>
of Syrian soda. But as is the case with all the treatises
of this class, the majority of the sections are concerned
with the preparation of the various ingredients by means
of which glass may be coloured—the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">colori da ismalti</span></i>.
The green and opaque red are both obtained from copper-scale,
the purple and crimson from various mixtures of
manganese<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c018'><sup>[162]</sup></a> (so spelt in the text), and the yellow either
from iron-scale or from a mixture of resin and tartar.
As for the fine blue—the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">zaffiro</span></i>—it should be noted that
the pigment employed is described as <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">azurro da vetro</span></i>,<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c018'><sup>[163]</sup></a>
probably a preparation of cobalt—similar to what in later
times was known as smalt—which the glass-workers
obtained ready-made from Germany.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the early sections of the third of these little
treatises<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c018'><sup>[164]</sup></a> the preparation of the soda is described in
some detail. Much importance appears to be attached
to the frit, for the third section is headed ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Questa si è la
pratica di fare la fritta, ciò è li pane del cristallino.
Nota ed impara.</span></i>’ In the composition of this frit there
enters not only soda and the white pebbles from the
Tecino, but a considerable amount of gromma or tartar,
a substance containing potash, and perhaps lime also.</p>

<p class='c001' >The preparation of ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">calcedonio in tutta perfezione</span></i>’ is
next described, and I may note that the presence in it of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_219' id='Page_219'>219</a></span>
salts of iron and copper, to say nothing of silver, mercury,
and <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">azurro</span></i>, would point to some variegated mixture
resembling the schmelz of later days rather than to the
opalescent glass to which this name was subsequently
given (cf. p. <a href='#Page_206'>206</a>).</p>

<p class='c001' >Of greater importance than any of these little treatises
is the work that Antonio Neri published in 1612. In
fact, having regard to the influence of this book on
future writers on the subject, especially upon those
who sought to make glass by Venetian methods in
England and elsewhere, it may without doubt be given
the premier place as the most important work that has
ever appeared on the preparation of glass. We know
very little of the author except that he was born in
Florence towards the end of the sixteenth century, that
he was a priest, and that he spent some time at Antwerp,
where it would seem that his attention was first directed
towards the manufacture of glass. When, after the death
of the Grand Duke Ferdinand in 1609, the manufacture
of the soft-paste Medici porcelain was abandoned, we are
told that in its place glass-works were established at
Pisa, and with these works we may perhaps connect
Neri’s little treatise. I have, however, already gone over
most of the ground covered by this book in my quotations
from Biringuccio and others, and I will postpone
the consideration of what little further is to be gleaned
from it until I come, in the account of our English glass,
to speak of the translation of Neri’s book made by Merret
in 1662.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_8 c006'     >In the history of European glass the culminating
point is perhaps reached in the Venetian glass of
the first half of the sixteenth century—I am speaking,
of course, from the artistic point of view. For a
century or more after this time our history is concerned
with little else than the spread of the Italian methods of
manufacture and decoration over the west of Europe.
After the middle of the seventeenth century the interest
becomes more and more centred in the technical and
economical improvements in the manufacture. The invention
of plate-glass by the French, in England the use
of coal instead of wood in the glass-furnace, and the
adoption of a heavy fusible type of glass containing lead
(an indirect consequence, perhaps, of this change of fuel)—these
are the really notable points in the history of the
first century of industrial advance. After the middle of
the eighteenth century England takes a more and more
important position, and the prominent question was the
production of a glass of high technical excellence at a
greatly reduced price. Preoccupied as we were at that
time with the absorbing interest of this industrial revolution,
less attention was given in this country to the
artistic side in the manufacture of glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the sixteenth century the interest of our subject
centres in the story of the emigration of skilled glass-workers
from Venice and from L’Altare, and in the more
or less complete replacement of the old methods, as these
Italians found their way into nearly every corner of
Western Europe. It was technically the victory of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_221' id='Page_221'>221</a></span>
carefully prepared <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> over the old mediæval <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre
de fougère</span></i> or <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">wald-glas</span></i>. From another point of view
the revolution was but one phase in the spread of the
Italian renaissance. In fact, in one respect it was distinctly
a renaissance, for the glass of Venice in composition
differed little from that made during the Roman
domination: it belonged essentially to the great Mediterranean
family of soda-lime glass, prepared, if not from
sea-weed, at least from maritime herbs. On the other
hand, the indigenous glass which the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> replaced
was almost without exception of forest origin, a potash
glass made from the roughly lixiviated ashes of beechwood
or bracken.</p>

<p class='c001' >I have said that these Italian glass-workers carried
their new methods all through Western Europe, but, as
we shall see, their permanent influence was not the same
in each case. In Germany it was in a measure but a
passing fashion—neither the Italian designs nor the
Italian methods of manufacture ever became prevalent.
The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">wald-glas</span></i>, in an improved form certainly, held its
own, and indeed before the end of the next century was
threatening the supremacy of its Venetian rival.</p>

<p class='c001' >In France, on the other hand, the victory was in a
manner complete; the old <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre de fougère</span></i>, it is true, long
survived, but in an acknowledged position of inferiority.
In the Netherlands the case was more complicated;
for while on the one hand at Antwerp and at Liége the
typical Venetian <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> was more successfully imitated
than elsewhere out of Italy, on the other hand, in many
places in the Low Countries, the old green glass continued
to be made, and the old shapes, above all the essentially
Teutonic <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemer</span></i>, never fell out of favour. It so happens
indeed that for the best renderings of examples of both
these schools of glass we must go to the works of the
Dutch and Flemish painters, rather than to the contemporary
pictures of either Germany or Italy. This is
an interesting point about which I shall have something
more to say later on.</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_222' id='Page_222'>222</a></span>
As regards Spain, the Italian influence became on the
whole predominant, but here the question is complicated
by the existence, in Catalonia at least, of a school of
enamelled glass of which the Venetian origin is by no
means certain, and this school was already well developed
before the end of the fifteenth century. Finally, in the
case of our own country, the Venetian emigrants who
came for the most part by way of the Low Countries,
had soon to divide the hitherto almost free field with
glass-workers from Normandy and Lorraine.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is only of late years that the full significance of
this emigration of glass-workers from Murano and from
L’Altare has been recognised. A distinguished Belgian
antiquary, M. Schuermans, President of the Cour d’Appel
at Liége, about the year 1880—following in this in the
steps of his countryman the late M. Alexandre Pinchart,
and in a measure also in those of M. Houdoy (<cite>Verrerie
à la façon de Venise</cite>, Paris, 1873)—began a systematic
investigation of the subject, and during a period of ten
years, from 1883 to 1892, contributed to the pages of
a learned periodical published at Brussels (<cite>Bulletin des
Commissions Royales de l’Art et de l’Industrie</cite>) a series
of letters—for so M. Schuermans modestly called them,
though they were in fact so many treatises, extending
some of them to more than a hundred pages—packed
full with the results of his researches. One of the most
curious sources of information M. Schuermans found in
the reports sent from the Venetian embassies and agencies
in France and elsewhere to the Council of Ten at Venice.
It was not the least important duty of the diplomatic
agents of the Republic to trace out the fugitive Muranese
glass-workers, to endeavour to induce them, by threats
or promises, to return to their homes, and if unsuccessful
in this, to denounce them to the authorities in Venice,
who might then proceed to throw into prison the unhappy
families of these recalcitrant workmen. In extreme
cases there are hints of more drastic measures in dealing
with the traitors themselves—for so they were regarded—but
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_223' id='Page_223'>223</a></span>
I do not think that any instance of assassination
has been definitely made out for the time of which we
are now speaking. It is certainly strange that the only
known cases of such judicial murders occurred at Vienna
as late as the eighteenth century. The story was told
long ago by Daru in his <cite>Histoire de Venise</cite> (<cite>Pièces
Justificatives</cite>), and I do not know that it has ever been
refuted.</p>

<p class='c001' >Not that these extreme measures were at all times
carried out with equal energy. At times, for political
or other reasons, little restraint appears to have been put
upon the wandering forth of the Muranese glass-workers;
while at others the Council of Ten seems to have regarded
the question as one of the utmost moment, aroused perhaps
by reports that seemed to prove that the glass
monopoly of the state was endangered. This was the
case at the end of the fifteenth century, again towards
the middle of the seventeenth, and more especially at the
end of that century, when the Venetians began to find
their industry seriously threatened by their German
rivals.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the sixteenth century, as a contemporary writer
puts it, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tous les rois et princes désiraient et affectaient
avoir en leurs royaumes cette science</span></i>’: that is to say, the
knowledge of the methods of preparing the true <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>.
To obtain this knowledge from Murano was difficult and
even dangerous. What wonder, then, that recourse was
had to the Consuls of the glass-workers’ guild at L’Altare?
These officials seem to have been always ready to
negotiate for the supply to foreign princes, or even to
private individuals—if the requisite payment was forthcoming—of
one or more of their skilled gentleman glass-workers.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c018'><sup>[165]</sup></a>
But in this case, too, a keen eye was kept
upon these men: they were bound by the strictest oaths
to practise their craft, when in foreign lands, with the
greatest secrecy; above all they were forbidden to take
any apprentices from the people among whom they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_224' id='Page_224'>224</a></span>
working. In France, where so many of these Altarists
settled, these restrictions were the cause of constant
friction, but so successfully were they as a rule enforced,
that we find that, in the case of more than one centre of
the new industry, it was necessary during a period of
at least a century to have recourse from time to time
to the original source at L’Altare, to replace the Italian
workmen who had died or wandered off to other towns.
For like their rivals from Murano, these Altarists were
always on the move. We are reminded in this of the
wandering porcelain ‘arcanists’ of the eighteenth century,
who carried from one German court to another the
secrets of their craft. To give but a single example;
M. Schuermans has traced one of these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gentilshommes de
verre</span></i> in migrations that led him successively to London,
Liége, Maestricht, Rouen, and Paris.</p>

<p class='c001' >In what respect, if in any, did the glass manufactured
by these ‘licensed’ craftsmen from L’Altare, differ from
that made by their rivals the ‘outlaws’ from Murano?
This is a question that we are not in a position to answer.
That there was some difference in style of working, and
not merely in the technical excellence of the glass, would
seem to be proved by the expression ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la façon
d’Altare</span></i>,’ or ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">ad uso d’Altare</span></i>,’ so often applied to it.
There is no doubt that the glass made ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la façon de
Venise</span></i>’ was, on the whole, regarded as of greater
excellence, and that in the impossibility of obtaining
workmen from Murano, the resort to the Consuls at
L’Altare was in a measure a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pis aller</span></i>. We must not,
however, as has sometimes been done, look upon the
craftsmen from the latter town as incapable of producing
anything of artistic merit. On the contrary, they not only
turned out a true <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>, but much of the enamelled
glass that was so successfully made in France in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries came in all probability
from furnaces worked by Altarists.</p>

<p class='c001' >In fact, our ignorance on this point affords an
excellent example of a difficulty that is met with again
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_225' id='Page_225'>225</a></span>
and again in this history of ours,—the difficulty, I mean,
of controlling our literary material by means of the
scanty examples of glass that have come down to us. It
would require a large shelf in a library to hold all the
bulky volumes dealing with the history of French glass
that have of late years been published, works that are
due above all to the local patriotism and the industry of
provincial investigators. For books of this kind, the
fashion was set as long ago as 1864 by M. Benjamin
Fillon in his <cite>L’Art du Verre chez les Poitevins</cite>. Since
then have appeared not mere <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brochures</span></i>, but in many cases
portly volumes tracing the history of the manufacture
in Normandy, Picardy, Lorraine, Nevers, Lyons, and
Provence. M. Schuermans has devoted to France a
long letter, chiefly concerned with the settlements of
Altarist workmen (<i>op. cit.</i>, vol. xxxi.). And yet not only
are specimens of glass, undoubtedly French, of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries comparatively rare,
but in very few cases can anything more than a guess
be made as to the provinces to which these specimens
are to be attributed. Such attributions indeed, when
attempted, have for the most part had to be based either
upon the armorial bearings forming part of the enamelled
decoration, or again upon the localities where the glasses
have been found—and these are criteria that fail in most
cases.</p>

<p class='c001' >Among the many anomalies that we encounter in the
course of this inquiry—and surely in no kindred branch
of art history are so many met with—there is nothing
more surprising than the numerous important ‘developments’
of glass of one kind or another, for which we may
search in vain a rational explanation—unless, indeed, it
is the corresponding fact of the unexplained barrenness
of certain periods and countries where such poverty
would have been the least expected. One source of this
apparent caprice in the presence or absence of glass of
artistic merit at times and at places where the contrary
might <a id='have'></a>have been looked for, may be found, perhaps,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_226' id='Page_226'>226</a></span>
in the fact that although, since Roman days at all events,
the making of glass has always been an important industry,
it is an industry that has only incidentally come
into connection with the æsthetic movements of the time.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c018'><sup>[166]</sup></a>
Some such explanation may perhaps be given for the
comparatively subordinate place taken by France in the
history of artistic glass, at least until quite recent
days. In one department of the vitreous arts the French
occupied no doubt for a time the premier place—the
stained glass of their cathedrals is acknowledged to be
the finest in Europe. But in our branch of the manufacture,
a branch for which, curiously enough, the French
alone have provided a name—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la verrerie</span></i>—that nation
has never occupied a prominent position. Since Roman
times, the first place as producers of glass vessels of
artistic importance has been held in succession by
Byzantine Greeks, by Saracens, by Venetians, by
Germans, and for a moment by the English. It is
only quite of late, since the commencement of the last
quarter of the nineteenth century in fact, that any claim
for such a position could be made for the French. And
yet, in spite of this, the literature of that special subdivision
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arts du feu</span></i> with which we are here
concerned is especially a French one, and this is true
not only for the technical and industrial side of the
subject, but for the artistic and historical in an even
greater degree.</p>

<p class='c001' >I have spoken of the determined way in which these
wandering Italians kept themselves apart from the native
workmen, so that the secrets of their craft were preserved
through more than one generation. In time, however, in
France at any rate, not a few of these Italian craftsmen
became sedentary, and not the least curious result of the
recent researches by French and Belgian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">archivistes</span></i> has
been to show how certain well-known families of glass-makers
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_227' id='Page_227'>227</a></span>
from L’Altare settled down in various parts of
France, where their representatives may now be found,
many of them still engaged in the same work. So that,
thanks to these investigations, the Saroldi of L’Altare
have been provided with distant cousins in the Sarode
family of Poitou; in similar manner the Ferri are represented
by the Ferry of Provence, great glass-masters at
the present day; the Massari by the Massary of Lorraine;
and the Bormioli by the Bormiolles of Normandy and the
Nivernais. All these four families were admitted long
since to the noblesse of France<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c018'><sup>[167]</sup></a> (Schuermans, <cite>Letter XI.</cite>,
1892).</p>

<p class='c001' >It is difficult to form any definite idea of the nature of
the craft secrets of these Italians. It can hardly have
related to the more obvious materials employed, for as
early as 1555 (and it was only about the year 1548 that
the great emigration of the Altarists began) the Oriental
soda, the <i>rocchetta</i> of Neri, which was brought by
Venetian galleys from Alexandria, had in France been
already displaced by the Spanish soda or <i>barilla</i>, a
material that has held its place until recent times.
This <i>barilla</i> was made from the famous soda plant, the
<i>Salsola sativa</i>, which, we are told, was grown from seed
in various parts of the province of Murcia, and exported
from the adjacent port of Alicante. So again the quartz
pebbles from the bed of the Ticino, so highly prized by
the early Venetian glass-makers, were early replaced by
the pure white sand of Étaples.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c018'><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >There is, however, in this connection, one point worth
notice. It is impossible to prepare a workable glass
from quartz and alkali alone; the presence of a certain
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_228' id='Page_228'>228</a></span>
quantity of lime is essential. Now in the forest glass—the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre de fougère</span></i>—sufficient lime (or equivalent bases)
is provided by the impurities in the crude potash employed;
but this is no longer the case when the more
carefully prepared Oriental or Spanish soda takes its
place: it is now necessary to supply additional lime. It
is not impossible that the secret of the shrewd Italians
may have lain in this direction.</p>

<p class='c001' >When speaking of the mediæval glass of France, I
have brought forward some evidence to show that, by the
fourteenth century at least, vessels of glass must have
been produced in large quantities for domestic use. This
of course was, without exception, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre de fougère</span></i>, essentially
the glass of the people, which for long was little
influenced by the new Italian methods. It was this glass
chiefly that was hawked round the country by itinerant
vendors. Their cry was well known in Paris—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gentils
verres, verres jolis—à deux liards les verres de pierre!</span></i>’
Others, as in old days at Rome (see the quotation from
Martial on <a href='#f52'>p. 82</a>, note), collected broken glass to the
cry of ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambrières, regardez-y!—Voirre cassez, Voirre
cassez!</span></i>’<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c018'><sup>[169]</sup></a> Bernard Palissy, writing towards the end
of the sixteenth century, gives but a mean idea not
only of the hawkers, but of the makers of glass in his
day:—‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je te prie, considère un peu les verres qui,
pour avoir esté trop communs entre les hommes, sont
devenuz à un prix si vil que la plupart de ceux qui
les font vivent plus méchaniquement que ne font les
crocheteurs de Paris ... et ces verres sont venduz et
criez, par les villages, par ceux mêmes qui crient les
vieux chapeaux et les vieilles ferrailles</span>’ (quoted by
Gerspach, p. 193).</p>

<p class='c001' >It was only when the secrets of the pure <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>
and the application of enamels were introduced from
Italy that glass began to take a more honourable position
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_229' id='Page_229'>229</a></span>
in France. We cannot safely trace back the foreign
influence to an earlier date than the middle of the
fifteenth century, and it was not brought into full play
till just a century later.</p>

<p class='c001' >The name of René, ‘king of Sicily and Jerusalem,’
and ruler under various titles in Provence, Anjou, and
Lorraine, was at one time a name to conjure with in
matters connected with art and literature, above all in
the south of France. Of late years there has been a
tendency to strip this much harassed king of many of his
claims to distinction as a patron of the arts. There
seems, however, every reason to connect his name with
the introduction of the finer sorts of glass into France,
not, of course, of the industry as a whole, though even
this was at one time claimed for René. There is evidence
to show that as early as 1443 a member of the
Ferro family<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c018'><sup>[170]</sup></a> of L’Altare was working for him at Goult,
in Provence. This would be the earliest instance known
to us of Italian glass-workers in France.</p>

<p class='c001' >King René, we are told, presented to his nephew
Louis XI. some pieces of glass ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">molt variolés et bien
peincts</span></i>.’ But we can hardly refer to so early a date the
beaker of enameled glass formerly preserved at Aix,
painted inside with the kneeling figure of the Magdalen
by the side of her Master, so arranged that the former
was only visible when the cup had been drained; so that,
as the inscription quaintly expressed it:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001' >It was but a few years later, in 1448, that the famous
charter of which a nearly contemporary copy has fortunately
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_230' id='Page_230'>230</a></span>
been preserved, was granted to certain glass-workers
in Lorraine by Jean de Calabre, governor of that duchy
in place of his father, King René. In this document we
have early evidence of the claim of the glass-workers to
the rights of gentlemen.<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c018'><sup>[171]</sup></a> Full recognition is given to the
‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plusieurs beaux droitz, libertez, franchises et prérogatives,
et dont eulx et leurs prédécesseurs ayant joui et usé
de tous temps passez et esté tenus et réputez en telle
franchise comme chevaliers estimez et gens nobles dudit
duchié de Lorrainne</span></i>.’ Then follows a list of all these
privileges, not the least important being the exemption
from ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toutes tailles, aydes, subsides, d’ost, de giste et de
chevaulchiées quelconques</span></i>.’</p>

<p class='c001' >This is by no means the earliest French document in
which the claim to some kind of nobility is made for the
profession. As far back as the later thirteenth century,
in the reign of Philippe le Bel, the glass-workers of
Champagne claimed similar rights, basing their pretensions
on certain edicts of Constantine and on others found
in the Theodosian Code! Charles <span class='fss'>VI.</span>, whose interest
in the manufacture of glass has been already referred
to (p. <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>), in his <cite>Lettres Royales</cite> of 1399, granted important
rights to the glass-makers, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à cause de la noblesse
du dict mestier</span></i>.’ These privileges, however, were confined
to those whose ancestors had followed the craft for
several generations.</p>

<p class='c001' >But for all this, these poor ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gentilshommes de verre</span></i>’
never obtained that complete recognition in France that
had always been granted to their brother craftsmen at
Venice and L’Altare, and their claims at times exposed
them to ridicule. There is an often-quoted epigram,
directed against one of their number (it is probably
by François Maynard, a follower of Ronsard), which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_231' id='Page_231'>231</a></span>
well expresses the popular feeling with regard to their
position—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001' >The question of these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gentilshommes verriers</span></i> was
fully discussed by the late M. Garnier in his book upon
glass (<cite>La Verrerie</cite>, p. 174 <i>seq.</i>), and he quotes passages
from contemporary documents to show both the extent
of the claims and the ambiguous position actually held
by these needy gentry in the eighteenth century. At
that time they were still always referred to as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gentilshommes</span></i>,
and they vindicated their social status by
fighting duels among themselves. Their position, however,
was often very wretched, less so, indeed, in
Normandy than in Lorraine, where the competition of
the Germans was so keen. It is a significant fact that
at the Revolution they as a body joined the party of
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">émigrés</span></i>, and actually petitioned M. D’Artois to enrol
them in a special corps. One point is clear: the profession
of glass-worker was at all times in France open
to the nobility, and this, of course, was not the case with
other crafts and trades.</p>

<p class='c001' >This long digression upon the position of the glass-workers
in France was started by certain expressions in
the charter granted to the glass-makers of Lorraine by
the son of King René. Not a little interest attaches
to the production of this eastern district; its history, as
concerns glass, differs from that of the more essentially
French provinces.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c018'><sup>[172]</sup></a> Here the Italians, whether from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_232' id='Page_232'>232</a></span>
Murano or L’Altare, appear to have had little influence.
In Lorraine, as in the lower Rhine country and in the
bishopric of Liége—closely related districts—the making
of glass had probably been carried on continuously from
Roman times. In the Ardennes, and especially in the
forests of Argonnes and in the Vosges, the manufacture
early took on a purely industrial character. At the end
of the sixteenth century it was claimed by the glass-makers
of the last district that they supplied Switzerland,
the Low Countries, and England with glass; and we shall
see later on that it was from glass-workers from Lorraine,
more definitely from the western Vosges, that we in
England learned so much in the later sixteenth century.
These Lorrainers owed their chief fame to their skill in
making window-panes and mirrors, and the old tradition
may be held to be still carried on in the great glass-works
at Baccarat, near Lunéville.</p>

<p class='c019' >I have no space to follow the working of the new
methods in Poitou and in the south, but a few words may
be said of the glass-houses established at <span class='sc'>Nevers</span> in
the sixteenth century. At that time the dukedom of the
Nivernais was held by the Gonzaga family of Mantua,
who had already acquired the marquisate of Montferrat,
upon which the town of L’Altare was dependent. Louis
of Gonzaga, who died in 1595, was as a patron of the arts
quite abreast of his time, and we may note that besides
his possessions in France and Italy he held much land in
Flanders and the Liége country, and that he was married
to a princess of the house of Cleves. The old town of
Nevers became for a time an artistic centre of some
importance. In the handsome renaissance palace built in
part by this said Louis (his arms are to be seen carved
in bold relief on the walls), there is now gathered together
an important collection of the enamelled fayence
for which the town is famous, and also a few examples
of the local glass, but none of this last is, I think, of so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_233' id='Page_233'>233</a></span>
early a date as the sixteenth century. Altarists had
doubtless come to Nevers before the time of the Duke
Louis, but it was during his rule that the Saroldo family
settled here, a family famous especially for their skill
in the use of glass enamels. To the Saroldo succeeded
the Ponta family; and in the seventeenth century Jean
Castellano came from Liége: in addition to these
Altarists, Venetian workmen were employed at times.
It is, indeed, a noticeable fact that here in the very centre
of France these glass-works should, for something like
two hundred years, have been dependent upon Italian
workmen.</p>

<p class='c001' >The glass of Nevers acquired some general renown in
the seventeenth century. Thomas Corneille, the younger
brother of the great dramatist, calls the town a ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit
Murane de Venise</span></i>,’ and praises the ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">variété des divers
ouvrages de verre qui s’y font et qu’on transporte dans
toutes les provinces de la France</span></i>.’ In this case—quite
exceptionally as regards France—we can associate a
special <i>genre</i> or application of glass—a somewhat trifling
one, to be sure—with the local glass-houses. In the
already mentioned museum in the Ducal Palace may be
seen some of these ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gentillesses a’émail propres à orner
les cabinets, les cheminées et les armoires</span></i>.’ Here may be
found landscape scenes with cows and shepherdesses
built up of fragments of glass of various colours,—these
childish compositions are apparently executed with the
blow-pipe. We are told in the journal of Jean Héroard,
the physician to Louis <span class='fss'>XIII.</span>, that when that king was
a child he amused himself with certain ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits chiens de
verre et autres animaux faits à Nevers</span></i>.’ Among the
scanty specimens of French glass in the British Museum
are some quaint little figures, about four inches in height,
built up of coloured glass enamels. We see there a little
statuette of Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> strutting along attired as a
Roman emperor; there is another of St. James the
Apostle. These characteristic examples of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i>
may very plausibly be referred to the glass-blowers
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_234' id='Page_234'>234</a></span>
of Nevers at the end of the seventeenth century<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c018'><sup>[173]</sup></a>
(<a href='#p35'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXXV.</span></a> 1).</p>

<p class='c019' >The province of <span class='sc'>Normandy</span> has played a not unimportant
part in the history of glass. It was from the
Norman duchy and from Brittany, according to the
tradition preserved at L’Altare, that the glass-workers
wandered forth in the tenth or eleventh century to find a
more peaceable home at L’Altare, in the mountains above
the Ligurian coast. As early as the year 1302 we hear
of the famous glass-house at La Haye, in the forest of
Lyons, near Rouen. This is in a charter which mentions
incidentally the bracken, the ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">feucheriam ad faciendum
vitrum</span></i>’—for all this early glass was, as I have said,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre de fougère</span></i>—which was to be cut only at specified
times. It was here, about the year 1330, that Philippe
de Cacqueray is said to have first made the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plasts de
verre</span></i>, otherwise known as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre de France</span></i>,<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c018'><sup>[174]</sup></a> for long the
most important product of the Norman glass-houses.
These <em>plasts</em> were indeed merely small sheets of glass,
with a thickening or ‘bull’s-eye’ in the centre; they were
made by the familiar ‘spinning’ process, which, however,
must surely have been known before the fourteenth
century. In any case this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre de France</span></i> was widely
exported at a later time, and much of it must have found
its way into England.<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c018'><sup>[175]</sup></a> It would appear that the gentlemen
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grosses verreries</span></i> where this window-glass was
made, held their heads above those of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petites verreries</span></i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_235' id='Page_235'>235</a></span>
which turned out only ‘hollow ware,’ and this fact would
point to the outcome of the latter works not being of a
very superior kind. If, however, we may judge from the
examples reproduced by M. Gerspach (<cite>L’Art de la
Verrerie</cite>, figs. 104-113) from the collection of M. le
Breton, who has done for Norman glass what M. Fillon
has done for that of Poitou, the table-ware made in
Normandy during the seventeenth century possessed no
little artistic merit, and what is more, it had a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cachet</span></i>
of its own.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the seventeenth century, however, the history of
glass in France centres round the manufacture of plate-glass
by the new process of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coulage</span></i> or casting. After the
middle of the century a demand arose in France for large
sheets of clear glass, not so much for windows, it would
seem, as for the tall mirrors that were now coming into
fashion, and again for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portières</span></i> of the ‘glass-coaches’
of the nobility. Colbert, the great minister of the early
and glorious days of Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span>, was in despair because
the large panes of glass suitable for these purposes had
to be obtained from Venice or from Nuremberg. After
an unsuccessful attempt to establish a colony of Muranese
workmen in Paris, Colbert had recourse to a Norman
family of glass-makers, the De Néhou, who had lately
succeeded the De Cacqueray at Tourlaville, near Cherbourg.
It was in 1675 that Louis Lucas de Néhou was
put in charge of the royal glass-works at Paris, where he
perfected his great discovery of the method of casting
glass. He was able to turn out sheets of unprecedented
size by a process in which the ‘metal’ was poured upon
frames, spread out evenly by rollers, and subsequently
polished.</p>

<p class='c001' >The <cite>Manufacture Royale des Glaces</cite> was removed in
1693 to the Château de St. Gobain, not far from Laon.
The St. Gobain works have for two hundred years held
a pre-eminent position in Europe for the manufacture of
plate-glass. This subject of plate-glass is indeed a little
outside our limits: for the student of the architecture
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_236' id='Page_236'>236</a></span>
and the decorative arts of the eighteenth century it is,
however, one of no little importance.</p>

<p class='c001' >I have been able to do little more than select a few
examples that have seemed to me of especial interest
from the well-filled records of the French glass-workers
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and many
important centres have been passed over without comment,—Nantes,
for instance, frequented above all by the
Altarists; and Poitou, the source, according to M. Fillon,
of many of the finest extant examples of French enamelled
glass. In both these districts members of the
Saroldo family settled—in Brittany they were prominent
for over two centuries.</p>

<p class='c001' >In Paris, or rather in the Isle de France, the glass-works
of St. Germain-en-Laye were for a time under
direct royal patronage. It was there, soon after 1552,
that Teseo Mutio made for Henri <span class='fss'>II.</span> ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verres, myroirs et
canons</span></i>.’<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c018'><sup>[176]</sup></a> Although the king pronounced Mutio’s work
to be equal to that of the Venetians, these glass-houses
had but a short life.</p>

<p class='c001' >In 1604 a special commission was appointed in Paris
to deal with the difficulty that arose from the obstinate
refusal of the Altarists to teach the French apprentices
the secrets of their craft. It was proposed to get over
this obstacle by the naturalisation of the Italians,
but to judge from the continued importation of fresh
batches of foreigners, this measure had but little practical
result.</p>

<p class='c001' >But what examples, it may be asked, can we point to
that would throw light on the nature of the glass made
during these centuries by this succession of Italians, to
say nothing of the production of the native <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gentilshommes</span></i>?
Nowhere in France, as far as I know, is
there to be found anything in the nature of a representative
collection to illustrate the history of native glass.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_237' id='Page_237'>237</a></span>
The nearest approach is no doubt to be discovered
in the scattered examples in the Louvre, and above all
in the Hôtel de Cluny, where there are many curious
specimens of the French enamelled glass of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is to the Venetian enamelled glass of the fifteenth
century, to the goblets of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">coppa nuziale</span></i> class, that
we must go back to find the prototype of what is by far
the most interesting family of French glass. In France
these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verres à pied</span></i>, enamelled with portrait-heads or
symbolical figures, continued in vogue well into the
seventeenth century, long after the fashion for such work
had passed away at Venice. The enamelling itself on
this French glass is not remarkable for brilliancy, but
there is often some native <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verve</span></i> in the treatment of the
figures, and a true Gallic ring about the mottoes and
verses that accompany them. Of these ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">devises, souhaits,
proverbes, dédicaces, vers et maximes</span></i>,’ we may distinguish
two classes: in the one case they are of a more or less
gallant character, or contain personal references; in the
other a religious sentiment or a pious quotation is found,
generally of such a nature as to suggest that the original
owner belonged to the reformed church. It is sometimes
difficult nowadays to seize the connection between the
device and the subject which it accompanies. Thus on a
fine stemless goblet in the Musée de Cluny we see three
halberdiers standing as on sentry duty; the accompanying
motto, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En la sueur de ton visaige tu mangeras le
pain</span></i>,’ has been interpreted as referring to the hard life of
the soldier. Of a more gallant character are the figures
and devices on a goblet of yellow enamelled glass in the
British Museum (Slade, No. 824). A gentleman in the
costume of the time of Henri <span class='fss'>II.</span> offers a flower to a lady
with the remark, ‘<span class='fss'>JE SUIS A VOVS</span>.’ The latter—she holds
a padlocked heart in her hand—replies ‘<span class='fss'>MÕ CUER AVÉS</span>.’
In addition to these figures we see a goat (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouc</span></i>) drinking
from a vase, and this we may connect with the inscription
that encircles the bowl—‘<span class='fss'>JE SVIS A VOVS JEHAN BOUCAU</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_238' id='Page_238'>238</a></span>
<span class='fss'>ET ANTOYNETE BOUC</span>.’ This is doubtless a marriage cup,
and the name Boucau points, it is said, to a Provençal
origin.</p>

<p class='c001' >As in our country, though in a somewhat less degree,
the Gothic feeling in design lingered long in France, at
least in the more remote provinces. An enamelled glass
basin, preserved in the museum at Rennes (figured by
M. Gerspach, p. 199), bears round the margin in large
Gothic letters the words—PRION ⁝ DIEU ⁝ QUI ⁝ NOUS ⁝
PARDON ⁝ 1597. On the ground of the style of decoration,
to say nothing of the lettering, this bowl might well, in the
absence of the date, have been referred to the fifteenth
century.</p>

<p class='c001' >Perhaps the oldest example that has been preserved
of this French enamelled glass is the tazza in the Cluny
Museum, with the arms of Louis <span class='fss'>XII.</span> and Anne of Brittany.
This cup must date from the early years of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p class='c001' >There is one variety of enamelled glass, Venetian in
its origin, which we in England generally associate with
France, although there are scant references to it in the
French authors who have described the glass of their
country. I refer to the ‘splashed’ glass, an old method
of decoration indeed, for we have found something very
like it on certain little unguent vases of the ancient
Egyptians. In the present case the enamels—red, yellow,
blue, and white—lie in oval masses on the surface, reminding
one in some cases of the sections of the pebbles
on a piece of polished pudding-stone. How these
enamels were splashed on to the unfinished <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paraison</span></i>
has been already described (p. <a href='#Page_64'>64</a>). I may add that the
little barrel-shaped flask (the <i>barillet</i> or <i>bariz</i> of the old
writers) to which this decoration is sometimes applied,
is a characteristic French form.</p>

<p class='c001' >Among the French glass in the British Museum may
be seen some little scent-bottles or burettes of moulded
glass, decorated with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</span></i> in relief. These are
generally attributed to a certain Bernard Perrot of Orleans,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_239' id='Page_239'>239</a></span>
to whom, in 1662, extensive privileges were granted by
Colbert. We are told by a contemporary writer (Abraham
du Pradel, <cite>Livre Commode</cite>, 1691) that this Perrot imitated
agates and gems as well as the porcelain of China,
and that he cast his glass into moulds to obtain bas-reliefs
and other ornaments. This early reference to the
copying of porcelain by means of opaque white glass is
of some interest. I do not know what precise source
has been found for the little cups of this milky glass of
which there are some examples among the French glass
in the British Museum—they are painted with a rudely
executed floral decoration of a somewhat Oriental type—but
they may without doubt be connected with one of
the many attempts made at this time or somewhat later
to imitate the porcelain of the Far East. This opaque
white French glass should be compared with a very
similar ware made at Barcelona, of which something will
be said in the next chapter.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_8 c006'     >Before going on to speak of the glass made in
Spain, it will be well to say a few words of that
made in the Spanish Netherlands during the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p class='c001' >Here, as might be expected from the course of trade,
the Venetian influence was early felt, and before long
became predominant. In the northern provinces, on the
other hand, the old Teutonic traditions, both as to form
and material, continued on the whole unchanged to a
much later period, so that the glass of the United Provinces
will be best dealt with in connection with that of
Germany.</p>

<p class='c001' >Already in the fourteenth century the Venetian galleys
brought the glass of Murano to the Flemish ports. In
some cases this glass was held worthy of being mounted
in silver. A goblet and an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aiguière</span></i> are mentioned in an
inventory of 1379 as the property of Charles <span class='fss'>V.</span> of France.
These pieces are indeed described as ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voirres blants de
Flandre</span></i>’: it is, however, very probable that they came
in the first place from Venice.</p>

<p class='c001' >As early as 1541 Venetian glass-workers were settled
at Antwerp, but, as in France, the great invasion took
place shortly after the middle of the century. It must
be borne in mind that what we know of the wanderings
of these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gentilshommes de verre</span></i> from Venice and from
L’Altare is derived almost exclusively from the researches
of Belgian antiquaries and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">archivistes</span></i>. In the already
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_241' id='Page_241'>241</a></span>
quoted works of Houday, of Pinchart, and above all in
the earlier and later letters of the Belgian judge, the
President Schuermans, we have a wealth of information.
M. Schuermans has traced these Italian glass-workers to
Antwerp, to Brussels, to Namur, to Liége, Maestricht
and Huy, and in the northern provinces to Bois-le-Duc,
Middelburg, Haarlem, and Amsterdam. There was a
great rivalry between the Muranese, who on the whole
predominated at Antwerp, and the Altarists, whom we
find for the most part at Liége: these were the two most
important centres. The Low Countries indeed became
before long a second home to these Italians, whence they
wandered out again to France, England, and Spain.</p>

<p class='c001' >While at Antwerp the true Venetian <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> was
imported free of duty, the imitations of that glass, the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voirre de cristal, à la faschion de Venise</span></i>, made over the
French frontier at Mézières or in Germany, and often
difficult to distinguish from the originals, were strictly
excluded, and these fiscal regulations were enforced by
the most tyrannical measures. The case is well put by
Mr. Hartshorne: ‘There were,’ he says, ‘in the Low
Countries in the beginning of the seventeenth century,
real Venetian glasses imported from Venice, Venetian
glasses legally made in the Low Countries, those illegally
made, and foreign imitations of Venetian glass’ (<cite>Old
English Glasses</cite>, p. 39). Apart from these varieties of
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> glass, the old <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre de fougère</span></i> doubtless continued
to be manufactured.</p>

<p class='c001' >Before the end of the sixteenth century, the glass-houses
of Antwerp where glass <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la façon de Venise</span></i> was
made had acquired a European reputation. They stood
quite apart from the other furnaces in France or in the
Netherlands where Italians were employed. Lodovico
Guicciardini, the historian of the Netherlands, speaks as
early as 1567 of the ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vassella di vetro alla Veneziana</span></i>’
made in Antwerp, and in the later editions of his work
(<cite>Descrizione di Tutti Paesi Bassi</cite>) some further details
are given. The testimony of another Florentine, Neri,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_242' id='Page_242'>242</a></span>
from whose little book on glass I have already quoted,
is still stronger. It was at Antwerp, he tells us, not at
Venice, that he had studied the processes of glass-making.</p>

<p class='c001' >If Antwerp thus early held a commanding position
in Spanish Flanders, in the Walloon country the glass-houses
of Liége in the course of the seventeenth century
grew to a position of even greater importance. This
was due above all to the enterprise of the great firm of
the De Bonhommes, who before the end of the century
had almost a monopoly of the glass trade in those
parts: they even established subsidiary works beyond
the frontier in such places as Verdun. They were one
of the first on the Continent to see the importance of the
new English flint-glass; at all events it is recorded that
as early as 1680 they made flint-glass <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l’Anglaise</span></i>,<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c018'><sup>[177]</sup></a> and
were thus able to withstand the Bohemian<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c018'><sup>[178]</sup></a> competition
which at that time was carrying everything before it.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the
Bohemian engraved glass was copied in both the Walloon
and Flemish parts of what is now Belgium. Indeed
when the latter district fell under Austrian rule early in
the eighteenth century, there was naturally a tendency
to encourage Bohemian methods of decoration. Specimens
of this engraved glass may be seen in the museums
of many Belgian towns, but I have seen nothing to equal,
in spirit and high finish, the contemporary engraved glass
of the United Provinces. As for the earlier <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>
made at Antwerp, say from 1550 to 1650, the difficulty
is to distinguish, in the case of the specimens that have
survived, the local work from that imported from Venice,
and we have evidence that even at the time the native
experts could not always do so.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c018'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_243' id='Page_243'>243</a></span>
I must in conclusion just say one word about a source
of information for the sixteenth and seventeenth century
glass of the Low Countries which is for the most part
wanting in the case of other countries. We have seen
how little can be learned from the works of contemporary
Venetian painters, of the famous glass of Murano (p. <a href='#Page_202'>202</a>).
But in the north it is quite otherwise; not only in the
pictures of the still-life painters, but in <i>genre</i> scenes, and
sometimes even in paintings of a devotional character,
we meet with carefully drawn examples of glass. It thus
happens that the works of the Flemish and Dutch
painters of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries throw
a great deal of light upon the kinds of glass to be found
both in the village alehouses and on the buffets of the
wealthy. We can take note of the competition of the
old heavy Teutonic forms with the Italian <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>, a
competition which continued in force during all this
period.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is, however, from a work of the Cologne school,
from a picture of the early sixteenth century, now in the
Louvre, representing the Last Supper,<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c018'><sup>[180]</sup></a> that I will take
my first example. Here on the table we see a decanter
with tall neck, delicately gadrooned, of distinctly Venetian
type. The drinking-glasses also are apparently of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>
of the well-known fifteenth-century form, without
stem or knop. The cup of Christ alone has a cover.
But there are also on the table several cups or beakers of
a deep green glass, studded with small bosses—‘prunted’
glass, in fact, of a pure Teutonic type.</p>

<p class='c001' >These two families of glass may be traced, often
side by side, in much later works—in the pictures
of the Flemish and Dutch schools of the seventeenth
century. In the paintings of the former school, however,
a clear white glass soon becomes prevalent even
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_244' id='Page_244'>244</a></span>
in humble surroundings. In the <i>cabaret</i> scenes of
Teniers, the peasant drinks his beer from a tall hexagonal
glass of thick whitish metal. The wine is kept in
spherical long-necked flasks—a very old type which we
have often met with in our history—a plug of rolled
paper taking the place of a cork; it is drunk from wide-mouthed
conical glasses of thin white metal. Similar
glasses appear indeed in the pictures of the Dutch
painters (as in more than one painting by Metsu and
De Hooghe in the National Gallery). But in Holland,
in the seventeenth century, the dark green or almost
black prunted goblets of <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemer</span></i> type were apparently
held in even greater estimation. In the famous terrace
scene of Jan Steen (National Gallery, No. 1421), the wine,
which is kept in a large pear-shaped glass vessel with a
stopper of wood, is drunk from a small graceful <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemer</span></i>.
In J. van de Velde’s still-life in the same collection
(No. 1255) we see again a magnificent <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemer</span></i>, of very
dark glass, with prunted stem and threaded foot, half
filled with Rhenish wine.<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c018'><sup>[181]</sup></a> But if we turn again to
the Flemish painters of this later time, we find that
when in rich interiors they introduce specimens of glass
among other <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">objets de vertu</span></i>, this glass is always of a
Venetian type. There is one such painter, a follower
of Jan Brueghel apparently, who loves to introduce
among a wealth of plate and jewellery, piled on tables
and shelves and even on the floor, the most elaborate
specimens of the fine <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> of Venice, proving in what
esteem this glass was then held in the Spanish Netherlands.
I might give many further examples, but enough
has been said to show that as in the case of porcelain, of
fayence and of plate, so for the history of glass, a mine
of information may be found in the <i>genre</i> and other
pictures of the Netherlandish school.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Spanish Glass</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >In the case of France we have seen how vast is the
amount of documentary evidence concerning the glass
of the renaissance, and how comparatively scanty on the
other hand the in every way more satisfactory evidence
to be drawn from the examination of existing specimens.
Now in the case of Spanish glass these conditions are in
some measure reversed. We here find the documentary
evidence almost entirely wanting, but we in England, at
any rate, have in the British Museum, and more especially
at South Kensington, fairly extensive collections of glass
from the Peninsula. I will not say that most of the
examples are of any great artistic, still less of technical
merit. Far too many pieces in the latter collection are
but sorry imitations of debased French and English
models of the eighteenth century, and even later times.
But as we shall see, not a few types, earlier in style if
not in actual date, may be distinguished, and these have
a distinct local flavour.</p>

<p class='c001' >This is the case above all with a class of rudely
executed vessels that are found in the south of Spain—in
Murcia, Andalucia, and Granada. The metal itself
is of a primitive type, of various shades of green and
bluish-green. Indeed, one of the points of interest in
this South Spanish glass is to be found in the fact that
it is essentially a glass of the people: it is a survival
from mediæval times, and it thus throws light upon the
long extinct <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre de fougère</span></i> or <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">wald-glas</span></i> that was made
all over the west of Europe before the introduction of
the Venetian <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>. Not that this Spanish glass is
necessarily of the inland or potash family; we are here
in a Mediterranean country, and the alkali has probably
been found in the native soda-holding barilla. The
shapes taken by this rude glass of the south of Spain
often resemble those found in the local pottery; one is
reminded at times of the graceful water-jars that are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_246' id='Page_246'>246</a></span>
indeed common to nearly all the Mediterranean coast.
A Moorish origin has been found for some of these
forms, but we may perhaps go further back and call
them Byzantine. The most characteristic shape is a
vase with spherical body and with a tall expanding
neck in the form of a truncated cone; neck and body
are united by a series of handles, often eight or more
in number (<a href='#p36'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXXVI.</span></a>). Now not only these handles,
with their upper and lower attachments worked while
hot by the pincers into toothed and crested forms, but
the whole of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appliqué</span></i> ornaments of the vessel—the
threadings and the rude floral reliefs—take one back to
a very old plan of decoration. This was a style much in
favour in later Roman times—it is one that is perhaps
<i>per se</i> the most characteristic and natural of all methods
of treating the surface of glass. A similar many-handled
vase is a common type among the peasant pottery of
the same districts of Southern Spain; on this we find
the same ring of handles, while the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appliqué</span></i> threadings
and rosettes of the glass are replaced by a similarly
applied slip ornament. This pottery is still manufactured
for local use, but I do not know whether any of the rude
green glass is produced at the present day.</p>

<p class='c001' >We have little or no information about the glass
made in Spain during the Moorish domination. There
is a vague tradition that the manufacture was carried on
in Murcia and Andalucia, and Al Makari, the historian,
states on the authority of an author of the thirteenth
century, that Almeria was famous for its vessels of glass
as well as for those of iron and copper.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c018'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >It is the district lying inland, some distance to the
north of Almeria, that has long, probably from Moorish
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_247' id='Page_247'>247</a></span>
times, been the centre of the glass industry of the south
of Spain;—this is especially true of Pinar de la Vidriera
and of Castril de la Peña. At this latter town, Don
Juan Riaño tells us, glass has been made from time
without memory, and indeed is still made there. ‘A
gallery one mile long which exists at the entry of the
town from which sand has been extracted for this
manufacture, gives an idea of the antiquity of this
industry’ (<cite>Industrial Arts of Spain</cite>, p. 232).</p>

<p class='c001' >There is only one other centre of the manufacture of
glass in Spain that need detain us. This lies in the
coast district of Catalonia, above all around Barcelona;
for this town we have direct evidence of the manufacture
as far back as the early part of the fourteenth century.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c018'><sup>[183]</sup></a>
At this time the Catalan mariners were the boldest and
the most skilful in the whole Mediterranean, and active
rivals of the Venetians in the ports of the Levant. Now
there is one variety of enamelled glass formerly attributed
to Venice, which, as is at present generally acknowledged,
has its origin in the Peninsula: much of it was made at
Barcelona. The prevailing note of the enamel on this
glass is a very beautiful apple-green, of two tints, one
passing into yellow. This colour is sometimes found
alone, at others associated with a few touches of other
enamels—a lavender blue, for instance, but these other
colours are of no great brilliancy. The green much
resembles that found on the enamelled glass of the
Saracens, where, however, this colour was always sparingly
applied. The patterns on the Catalan glass are
generally of a formal floral character, often built up of
sprigs radiating from a centre. But technically the most
noticeable point in this enamel is the method of its
application. As in the case of the Saracenic glass, it is
laid on with a loaded brush; it lies in thick semi-transparent
masses on the surface. As a result we have
a rich and jewel-like effect that we may look for in vain
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_248' id='Page_248'>248</a></span>
in the flat opaque painting that we see on so many
European wares. There are several pieces of this glass
in the British Museum, but the most beautiful example
that I have seen is in the Museo Civico at Venice. This
is a little flask lately acquired from the Maglione collection
at Naples; the dominant green enamel is here
relieved by some yellowish foliage and by red and
white birds.</p>

<p class='c001' >I do not think that any existing example of this green
enamelled glass could be safely referred to an earlier date
than the end of the fifteenth century. But it is not
improbable that the Catalans learned the use of these
enamels not from the Venetians, but directly from Saracenic
or Jewish glass-workers in some of the ports of the
Levant. Such a distant source for this decoration,
which is indeed somewhat Oriental in character, I think
more probable than a local one in Spain, for we have no
evidence that the Moors, when they held the Peninsula,
ever practised the art of enamelling glass, nor indeed
were the Catalans, after very early times, ever brought
much into contact with their Mohammedan neighbours:
their main dealings were with the Levant.</p>

<p class='c001' >That the glass of Barcelona was widely known and
held in some repute before the end of the fifteenth century,
the following notices go far to prove. As early as
1491—so it is stated in a contemporary Latin manuscript—glass
vessels of various shapes, resembling those made
at Venice, were exported to Rome from Barcelona. Again,
when Philippe le Beau passed through the latter town in
1503, we are told that he went ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en dehors de la ville
veoire ung four ou faict voires de cristallin très beaus</span></i>’
(Schuermans, <cite>Bulletin</cite> xxix. p. 138 <i>seq.</i>). Finally, Ferdinand
of Aragon, about the same time, is reported to
have sent to Queen Isabella a present of 274 pieces of
glass manufactured in Barcelona. That this glass must
have been possessed of some artistic merit we may infer
from the fact that the Queen presented several pieces
to the Capella de los Reyes at Granada. These we may
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_249' id='Page_249'>249</a></span>
perhaps identify with the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vasi di vedro</span></i> seen among the
treasures of this chapel a few years later by the Venetian
ambassador (Andrea Navagero, <cite>Viaggio in Spagna et in
Francia</cite>). M. Gerspach, I may add, calls attention to an
inventory drawn up during the reign of Philip <span class='fss'>II.</span>, in
which, under the heading of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">bidrios de Barcelona</span></i>, 119
pieces of glass of various forms are catalogued; among
other things—and this is a point of great interest—mention
is made of some enamelled lamps.</p>

<p class='c001' >At a much later date, not before the eighteenth
century probably, a good deal of opaque white glass,
in imitation of porcelain, was made at Barcelona. At
South Kensington may be seen a series of quadrangular
flasks of this material with bevelled edges, about six inches
in height. These flasks—they probably served to hold
essences and spirits—are somewhat rudely painted with
floral designs in bright primitive colours—red, blue, and
yellow. Both in India and Persia we come across examples
of glass decorated with ‘painted’ enamels, almost
identical in shape and size with these Spanish bottles.
Not only these, but some of the sherbet-jugs and coffee-cups
of this milky glass, that are still often found in many
parts of the East, may well have come from this district.
It will be remembered, however, that a very similar ware
was made about the same time both in France and at
Venice.</p>

<p class='c001' >Other towns in Catalonia, as Cervelló, Almatret, and
above all Mataró, became famous for their glass in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. There is more
than one record of distinguished foreign princes who
were conducted in royal galleys to visit the glass-works
of this last town.</p>

<p class='c001' >M. Schuermans has discovered the names of more
than twenty Italians from L’Altare or from Venice, who
found their way to Spain, in some cases by way of
Flanders. At Lisbon, too, in the seventeenth century,
there were many foreign glass-makers, Muranese, Altarists,
and Flemings.</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_250' id='Page_250'>250</a></span>
At Cadalso, in the province of Toledo, glass-furnaces
were at work as early as the beginning of the sixteenth
century; indeed they are said at that time to have
supplied the whole kingdom of Castile. At these works,
at a somewhat later time, the Italian influence became
very strong, and no doubt many Muranese or Altarists
were employed.</p>

<p class='c001' >Before the end of the seventeenth century, the general
decline so noticeable in all the industries of Spain spread,
it would seem, to the glass-works. Workmen were now
obtained chiefly from the Low Countries, and in addition
much glass was imported by sea from Antwerp. To
how low a state the glass industry had fallen at this time
may be inferred from the fact that orders for ‘Mexico and
the Indies’ had to be executed abroad. In the next
century, when Spain had lost her Flemish possessions,
their place as a source of glass-ware was taken by France.
Philip <span class='fss'>V.</span>, about the year 1720, founded a royal glass
manufactory near his summer palace of La Granja de
S. Ildefonso, and workmen were gathered together from
all sources—there were Germans and Swedes as well as
Frenchmen. These works were above all established, in
rivalry to St. Gobain (p. <a href='#Page_235'>235</a>), for the preparation of large
mirrors of plate-glass, but all sorts of ‘hollow ware’ were
also produced there. This later Spanish glass, made to
royal order, is, however, utterly devoid of any interest,
and it need not detain us.</p>

  <h2 id='ch16' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />THE GLASS OF GERMANY<br />The Green Glass of the Rhine and the Netherlands—Enamelled Glass</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_8 c006'     >It is as a matter of practical convenience that I have
chosen not to make a separate division for the
‘green glass’ of the Dutch of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. Not that Holland was in any way
dependent on Germany in this matter, but in the case
of this, the first of the three main divisions of German
glass of which I have to treat in this and the following
chapters—the plain or prunted green glass—the produce
of the two countries is very similar. Our second group—the
family of enamelled glass, so important in Germany—is
scarcely represented at all in Holland. On the
other hand, in the case of our third group, the Dutch
struck out a line of their own. I shall therefore treat of
the engraved glass of Holland in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is remarkable how little is known of the nature
of the glass made in Germany before the first half of the
sixteenth century, when the Italian influence began to
make itself felt. A few insignificant little bowls and
some small flasks that have served as reliquaries have
been preserved in the treasuries of German churches
(<a href='#p21'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXI.</span></a>), but for our principal source of information we
are dependent upon contemporary pictures. Here, however,
we soon discover that it is rather to works of the
early Netherlandish school that we must turn for information,
and that even from this source practically nothing
is to be gleaned until about the second quarter of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_252' id='Page_252'>252</a></span>
fifteenth century. What is then found is not of much
note, small tumbler-like vessels for the most part, of
thick greenish glass decorated with threadings or studs,
the latter more or less of the nature of prunts. There is,
however, one fifteenth-century form which is of some
interest: the metal-mounted wooden cups of mazer-like
form, in use at that time appear to have been copied
in glass; these may be recognised by their peculiar
stunted and sometimes coiled handles.<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c018'><sup>[184]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >These somewhat primitive vessels of the fifteenth
century are of interest as leading the way to the first
important division of German glass, the ‘Green Glass’
of Western Germany and the Netherlands.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c018'><sup>[185]</sup></a> It is worthy
of note that this family of glass, essentially of local
origin not only as regards the nature of the metal but
also in respect of the shape and the method of decoration,
only reached its full development in the course of the
sixteenth century, at a time when the new <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>
was being made by Italian workmen in the same
district. There must have been something like a conscious
reaction in favour of the native forms and
materials. As to the pronounced green colour, we
know that this was held to enhance the flavour of the
wine drunk from the glass; as far back as the early
sixteenth century, iron and copper scale were purposely
added to supplement the pale tint given by the iron
contained in the impure native potash (Mathesius,
<cite>Sarepta</cite>, cxciv.).</p>

<p class='c001' >In the decoration of this green glass recourse was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_253' id='Page_253'>253</a></span>
had to the old methods of threading, but above all to
the more or less circular projections or bosses of varied
forms that are found scattered over the sides. These are
technically known as ‘prunts’—the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">nuppen</span></i> of the Germans.
We have had something to say of one special form of
these protuberances when describing the glass of the
Anglo-Saxons.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c018'><sup>[186]</sup></a> These prunts fall into two groups: the
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">stechel-nuppen</span></i> or thorned prunts, of which the old
Franco-Saxon form is an extreme type; and the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">beeren-nuppen</span></i>
or berry prunts, derived possibly in the first
case from the moulded reliefs of bunches of grapes
that we find so often on Roman glass. A third group
might perhaps be made for another classical form
where the projections take the shape of a medallion—a
head stamped on the surface of the prunt while it is
still soft.</p>

<p class='c001' >These <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">nuppen</span></i> had a practical use,—so Mathesius, a
contemporary writer, tells us.<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c018'><sup>[187]</sup></a> They were to prevent the
glass from slipping between the fingers of the drinker.
With a similar object—for the <em>insertion</em> of the fingers in
this case—these prunts are sometimes reversed, forming
deep pits in the sides of the vessel. There is a late
example of this form at South Kensington and another
in the British Museum. The <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">stechel-nuppen</span></i> may assume
less aggressive forms; the points may be smoothed
down while the metal is soft, and we then have merely a
series of disc-like thickenings on the sides of the glass.
By this means, as in the more refined Dutch <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemer</span></i> of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_254' id='Page_254'>254</a></span>
the seventeenth century, effects of great beauty, due to
the varying transparency of the glass, were obtained.</p>

<p class='c001' >In colour this Rhenish glass may vary from a greenish-blue
to a pale bottle-green, or again to a deep, almost
black, tint of olive-green or violet. It is from glass of
this description that the pale-coloured wines of the
country have been drunk, perhaps without break, from
late Roman times. This it is, as well as the fact that it
has never been decorated with enamel, and rarely, in
Germany at least, by the wheel or with the diamond,
that has given to the green prunted glass of this family a
position apart. I have called this glass Rhenish, inasmuch
as the centre of the manufacture seems to have
been around Cologne, whence some of it found its way
down the river to the Low Countries, along with the wine
that was drunk from it; but much green glass was, we
know, made also in the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c001' >From the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">cultur-historisch</span></i> point of view, perhaps the
most striking claim to attention of this family of German
glass lies in the fact that here we come across the one
original and artistic form of wine-glass that has been
developed in modern times—apart, that is, from the
stemmed glass of Italian origin, about which there will
be a good deal to say in a future chapter. The typical
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemer</span></i>—for this of course is the glass of which I am
speaking—consists of three parts: a bowl of ovoid outline,
shaped like the flower of a tulip; a hollow cylindrical
stem, studded with mulberry-like prunts (often flattened
out to discs); and a hollow conical foot, formed by coiling
a rope of glass round a core of wood (<a href='#p37'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXXVII.</span></a>).
Here we have the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemer</span></i> in the fully developed form of
the seventeenth century, as we see it in fact in the still-life
pictures of the Dutch painters of the time, or again—this
time in actual use—in the marksmen’s banquets
(<i>schuttersmaaltyd</i>) of Van der Helst and Frans Hals.
In the earlier forms, however, the foot is either entirely
missing or is present only as a zig-zag or toothed ring
of glass applied to the base of the stem. In these early
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_255' id='Page_255'>255</a></span>
examples again the broad hollow stem is not divided
from the bowl by a diaphragm of glass, but forms an integral
part of the cup.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c018'><sup>[188]</sup></a> On the other hand, before the end
of the seventeenth century the cylindrical stem was more
and more encroached upon by the spun-foot, while the
coiled threading with which in earlier days the conical
foot was entirely built up was, in late examples, twisted
round a glass support so as to become a mere ornament<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c018'><sup>[189]</sup></a>
(Czihak, <cite>Schlesische Gläser</cite>, pp. 75 <i>seq.</i>, and Hartshorne,
<cite>English Glasses</cite>, pp. 66 <i>seq.</i>).</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c001' >Of the Rhenish green glass, the only other forms
that I shall mention are the upright barrel-shaped beaker
covered with prunts of various forms, in which the
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mai-trank</span></i>, a kind of ‘cup,’ was brewed, and finally the
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Krautstrunk</span></i> or cabbage-stalk, a tall cylindrical glass
bristling with formidable thorny prunts. Mathesius,
who is responsible for the picturesque name, already in
the seventeenth century calls the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Krautstrunk</span></i> an old
form. The form is indeed noticeable, for among this
family of green glass it is the only important instance
of the cylindrical shape so much in favour for the
enamelled ware.</p>

<p class='c001' >The green glass as a group is very poorly represented
in our London museums; as I have said, it can best be
studied in the works of the Dutch painters. The handsome
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemer</span></i> in Jan van de Velde’s still-life piece (National
Gallery, No. 1255) may be taken as a typical example.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Venetian Influence in Germany</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >We must now turn again to the glass of Venice, and
consider how far and in what direction its influence can
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_256' id='Page_256'>256</a></span>
be traced upon that made in the north. This much we
know—that in the fifteenth century, and perhaps earlier,
the Venetian glass was largely imported into Germany,
and this not only on the backs of hawkers, for the large
Venetian firms had agencies in many German cities.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c018'><sup>[190]</sup></a>
There were at that time depôts of the Venetian merchants
at such comparatively remote places as the Silesian
towns of Görlitz and Breslau, and early in the fifteenth
century the Italian glass was sold in the market-place
of Vienna. At this time, however, we are unable to
trace any influence these importations may have had
upon the local German glass—of this last, indeed, practically
nothing is known. It would seem that it was not
until the sixteenth century was well advanced that any
attempt was made in Germany to compete with the
Venetian <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>. Like the mediæval glass of France
and England, the earlier German glass was doubtless
a mere household ware, of all descriptions the least likely
to be preserved.</p>

<p class='c001' >It was in Southern Germany—in Switzerland and
Swabia, and still more in the wealthy towns of Augsburg,
Regensburg, and Nuremberg—that the Italian influence,
in the matter of glass as in the other departments of the
arts, was most strongly felt. As early as 1531 the town
council of Nuremberg granted a subsidy to promote the
introduction of the Venetian methods of making glass.
We are told that Augustin Hirschvogel (<i>d.</i> 1560), a
member of the well-known family of glass-stainers,
some of whom we shall meet again before long, was
interested in the question, and, according to one account,
he learned the secrets of the art at Murano. In any case,
there exist specimens of what is undoubtedly German
glass, decorated with coats-of-arms of local families, both
the shapes and the enamelling of which carry us back
to the Venetian enamelled glass of the early sixteenth
century. Good examples of this ware may be found in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_257' id='Page_257'>257</a></span>
the richly enamelled pilgrims’ flasks, of which there are
examples in the Germanic Museum at Nuremberg and
in the British Museum. In such specimens the Italian
influence is seen not only in the beadings and the gilding,
but in the nature of the metal itself. How strong
this southern influence was in these parts in the second
half of the sixteenth century we may see in the work of
the contemporary goldsmiths. In the case of glass, however,
the purely Italian forms seem to have been early
abandoned, and the same may be said of the style of the
enamels employed in the decoration.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of a later time than these South German examples of
enamelled ware are the even more definite copies of the
sixteenth-century glass of Venice that were made in the
neighbourhood of Cologne. Here we have deliberate
imitations of the Italian models—tall-stemmed glasses of
thin <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> with wide-winged handles, the latter often
of deep blue metal. There is a row of these <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">flügel-gläser</span></i>,
as the Germans call them, arranged on an upper shelf
in the British Museum; some of these may perhaps be
referred to the glass-house at Dessau, where Italians
were employed between 1679 and 1686, but as a whole
such glasses must be of a somewhat earlier date than
this. In any case, we must regard these <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">flügel-gläser</span></i>
as exotic growths, which lie quite apart from the two
great German groups of the seventeenth century—I mean,
of course, the enamelled and the engraved glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >In fact, the real influence of the new <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> of Venice
was exerted in another direction. People who had seen
this clear white glass were no longer content with the
thick heavy metal of varying hues of green, blue, and
yellow, often full of bubbles and defects. Already early
in the sixteenth century in various parts of Germany
attempts were made to introduce the Venetian methods
of working, above all the Venetian materials. Now the
Germans of that day were a practical people, already well
ahead in many of the technical arts, above all in those
relating to mining, to the smelting of metals, and to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_258' id='Page_258'>258</a></span>
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arts du feu</span></i> generally. After a moment of hesitation,
instead of merely copying the formulas that they learned
from the Italians, they adapted them to the conditions
of their own country, and thus were soon able, in the
central mountain districts among a population of miners
and woodmen, to establish a glass industry quite independent
of foreign aid. In France, on the other hand,
and still more in England, up to the end of the seventeenth
century, whatever glass of artistic character was
produced was made for the most part by foreign workmen,
and to some extent with foreign materials. Perhaps
the most striking instance of the independent line taken
by the German glass-workers may be found in the continued
use of potash made from the beechwoods of their
forests, and with this alkali they were soon able to produce
a glass as brilliant and colourless as the soda-made
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> of the south.</p>

<p class='c019' >So far we have only got to the fringe of our subject;
for the green glass of the Rhine and Holland can in no
way be regarded as characteristic of German glass as a
whole. Such glass I would rather class as Lotharingian,
using that term for that central land that is neither
French nor quite German. In so doing I am of course
treading on delicate ground; but I am prepared to maintain
that it is rather in a heavily enamelled <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">willkomm-humpen</span></i>
of plain cylindrical form from Saxony or Franconia
than in a prunted <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemer</span></i> of green glass that we
have a really characteristic type of the glass of Germany.</p>

<p class='c001' >And this brings us to the question, to how much of
this Central German glass the term Bohemian may be
fairly applied? This at least may be safely said, that the
expression ‘German glass from the Bohemian frontier’
would cover nearly the whole of it. What it is essential
to remember is that with the exception of a small section
of the engraved glass we have little to do with Prague
and the Czecs of the central plateau of Bohemia. As a
whole this glass was made by German-speaking people
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_259' id='Page_259'>259</a></span>
dwelling on either side of the mountains which gird
Bohemia to the north-east, the north-west, and the south-west,
and divide that kingdom from Silesia, from Saxony,
and from Bavaria respectively. Of all these districts it
may be said that wherever the pines and beeches of the
wooded slopes provided both fuel for the furnaces and
(from their ashes) the indispensable potash, wherever,
too, from the hillsides a pure white sand could be
extracted, and finally, wherever in the mountain streams
a source of power for cutting the wood or grinding the
glass was at hand, there a glass furnace would sooner
or later be established.</p>

<p class='c001' >Starting from the gorge of the Elbe above Dresden,
to the east a complicated system of mountains covers the
frontiers of Bohemia and Silesia. In the valleys that
run down on either side glass has been made from the
fourteenth century, if not before. It must not be forgotten
that until it was seized by Frederick the Great in
the eighteenth century Silesia had long been a dependence
of the crown of Bohemia.<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c018'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >To the west, beyond the gorge of the Elbe, the high
plateau of Misnia falls abruptly on the Bohemian side,
forming the Erzgebirge. Although for the glass of this
district, the classical land of mining and metallurgy, we
have no modern work to fall back upon, yet in the sixteenth
century it produced two important writers on
metallurgy and mining—Georg Agricola, the learned professor
of chemistry, and the Lutheran divine Mathesius.
Both of these writers have something to say upon the
contemporary processes of glass-making.</p>

<p class='c001' >At the western extremity of the Erzgebirge, on the
one hand the Fichtelgebirge forms a link joining those
mountains to the Thüringer Wald—these are both essentially
German forest districts where much glass was made;
on the other hand the Böhmer Wald runs south-east
to the Danube. On the southern slopes of the latter
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_260' id='Page_260'>260</a></span>
range was made much of the glass that supplied the rich
Franconian and Bavarian cities.</p>

<p class='c001' >And the mention of these towns brings us to this
difficult question: How far was the enamelling and
the engraving of the finer specimens carried out in the
mountain valleys where the glass was made, and how far
in the workshops of the cities to which the undecorated
glass had been transported?</p>

<p class='c001' >For the northern districts at least Herr von Czihak
has brought forward much evidence to show that the
artists in the local towns carried back to the mountain
furnaces, to be there fired, the glass that they had painted
with enamel colours, and that even the finer kinds of
engraving were done in the upland villages where water-power
was abundant. This was certainly the case in later
days in the famous centre of glass-engraving that grew
up at Warmbrunn, in the Hirschberg district of Silesia.
On the other hand much glass was, it would seem,
enamelled in Dresden, and in the south the finer work
both of the enameller and the glass-engraver was probably
executed in the studio of the artist—at Nuremberg,
for instance, or in other Franconian or Swabian towns.</p>

<p class='c001' >For the German glass of the sixteenth century we
have fortunately the two already mentioned contemporary
writers, both of them Saxons by birth—Georg Agricola
and Johann Mathesius. Agricola, it is true, ‘the founder
of the sciences of mineralogy and metallurgy,’ in his
famous work <cite>De Re Metallica</cite>,<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c018'><sup>[192]</sup></a> devotes only a few pages
at the end of his last chapter to the subject of glass;
but here may be found the first accurate drawing of a
glass furnace that has come down to us. Agricola
mentions that he had passed two years at Venice, and
had seen much of the glass-working when there.<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c018'><sup>[193]</sup></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_261' id='Page_261'>261</a></span>
Indeed, what he says of the materials, of the source of
the alkali above all, seems to have relation to the Italian
rather than to the German glass.</p>

<div class='figcontainer'>

<p class='ce-caption'>GERMAN GLASS FURNACE<br />

</div></div>

<p class='c001' >But this is not the case with the furnaces, which he
describes and illustrates. Agricola distinguishes three
separate ovens: the fritting oven; the main oven, where
the glass is melted in pots; and an annealing oven for
slowly cooling the glass. These ovens, however, may be
combined in various ways in smaller works, reducing the
number to two or even to one. The fritting oven is a
detached building of beehive shape, which is also used
for annealing the pots. The main oven, eight feet in
height and ten feet in diameter, is of a similar outline.
The wood is burned on the floor of a lower chamber,
without any grating of firebars; the flame passes through
into an upper chamber, around which are arranged eight
pots, each two feet in height, with a working-hole in
front of each pot. From the back of this chamber a
passage opens which conveys the heated gases to the
quadrangular annealing oven.</p>

<p class='c001' >Surely so much information has rarely been compressed
into one print as we find in the main illustration
to this part of Agricola’s text (<a href='#p38'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXXVIII.</span></a>). Here at
one working-hole (<i>fenestrella</i>) we see a workman gathering
the glass at the end of his <i>fistula</i> or blowing-iron,
another is shaping the gathering upon the marver at
his foot, a third is vigorously blowing the <i>paraison</i> to
the required size, and a fourth is swinging another
round his head. On the ground lie scattered moulds of
various forms, and here, too, we may discover the forceps
(<i>pucella</i>) used in shaping the glass. To the right, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_262' id='Page_262'>262</a></span>
foreground, lies a large wooden case closely packed with
glass vessels of various shapes: we can distinguish,
I think, bottles, alembics, and some prunted cylinders,
which may well be the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Krautstrünke</span></i> of Mathesius.
Above, to the right, the itinerant hawker marches off
with a fresh supply of glass of all shapes arranged in
an open-work crate strapped on his back. Finally, to
the left, in a little office, the master discusses business
with a customer over a foaming glass of beer—this last
a truly German trait.</p>

<p class='c001' >Our other source of information for the German glass
of the sixteenth century is found, of all places in the
world, in a collection of so-called sermons written by the
friend, table-companion, and biographer of Luther—Johann
Mathesius (1504-1565). Mathesius, after leaving
Wittenberg, settled as pastor at Joachimsthal, a famous
mining centre on the southern slopes of the Erzgebirge.
These <cite>Sermons for Miners</cite><a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c018'><sup>[194]</sup></a> are a strange mixture of
what to us seem fantastic analogies drawn from the
Bible, with matter of an eminently practical nature relating
to the crafts and occupations of his audience.
The title of his fifteenth sermon will give some idea of
how he treats the subject:—‘Of glass and the making
of glass, and passages where it is mentioned in the
Holy Writings, and how we may thereby call to mind
both the fragility of our present bodies and the clearness
and brilliancy of our bodies in the future state.’</p>

<p class='c001' >A careful perusal of what both these writers have to
say on the manufacture of glass leaves the general impression
that in the first half of the sixteenth century
Germany had not made much progress in that art. It is
to Venice, in the first place, and then to Antwerp, that
Mathesius turns for brilliant examples. At Murano, he
tells us, they can actually make panes of glass ‘through
which from one’s room one can see all that is passing in
the street.’ So too, he says, it is in that town and in
Antwerp that is made the finest <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">schmelzglas</span></i> of all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_263' id='Page_263'>263</a></span>
colours used by the goldsmith—above all the mysterious
<i>ritzkel</i>.<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c018'><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >‘Now,’ says Mathesius, ‘we come to the German
glass-houses. Some have their own sand, others pound
white quartz and pebbles. They make use of the ashes
of oak, maple, beech, and pine; the ashes of the fir and
of the willow turn out good work, but from their fatty
nature yield glass that is not so white. Native salt is
added also to the sand and ashes, but the Polish rock-salt
is more advantageous. Many buy up broken glass
and make with it the best work.’<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c018'><sup>[196]</sup></a> If you wish, continues
Mathesius, to obtain white and pure glass, it is essential
to use only well dried wood, for green wood makes the
glass opaque and blackish. The metal should be cooled
more than once and remelted, the glass-gall being carefully
skimmed off each time. If you propose to make
fair and pure glass, ‘neither bubbly, feathery, cloudy,
dull, stony, or gritty,’ prepare your frit carefully by
rabbling and turning over the mixture of sand, potash,
and salt on the floor of the first furnace, in the same way
as metallic ores are treated ‘when they are roasted by the
valuable new process.’ (Whatever this may have been, it
was an illustration that would appeal to his audience of
miners.) When the mixture begins to sinter together,
the stuff should be shovelled into cold water. The frit
thus prepared is then placed in the melting-pots and
gradually heated.</p>

<p class='c001' >There then follows a careful account of the various
processes involved in the blowing and shaping of the
vessel: of this I will only remark that there is no mention
in it of the use of the shears for trimming the rough
edges of the glass—technically an important point.</p>

<h3 class='c020'><span class='sc'>Enamelling on German Glass</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c001' >We are now able to form some idea of the processes
by which glass was made in Central Germany about
the middle of the sixteenth century, and when we come to
examine the glass itself by the aid of extant examples, it
will be found that this is indeed the date from which the
start must be made, for there are few pieces in our collections
that can claim a greater antiquity.</p>

<p class='c001' >It was apparently not long before this time that the
Germans began to apply enamels to their drinking-vessels
whether of glass or pottery. Mathesius (1562) speaks of
enamelling as a new art. ‘The ready wit of man,’ he
says, ‘is always finding something new; some have on
the white glass painted all kinds of pictures and mottoes,
and burnt them in, in the annealing oven,<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c018'><sup>[197]</sup></a> as we find
the “counterfeits” of great men and their arms <em>painted
upon the panes that are set in our windows</em>.’ This is an
important passage which confirms what we might otherwise
be led to infer—namely, that the origin of the
enamelling that we find on the beakers of the German
renaissance must be sought, not in the fifteenth and
early sixteenth century enamelled glass of Venice, but
rather in the new method of colouring window-glass
that was at this time spreading all over Germany. I
refer to the highly finished pictures, <em>painted in enamel
colours</em> on white glass and subsequently burned in,
which were now replacing, especially for secular use, the
true lead-mounted stained glass of the old church
windows. It was an easy step to apply this method of
decoration to the cylindrical surfaces of the great tankards
and goblets from which the German people drank their
beer. Now it is not in Northern or Central Germany
that we find the best specimens of these enamelled
‘quarries.’ The finest examples come from the south,
from Nuremberg, from Swabia, and above all from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_265' id='Page_265'>265</a></span>
Switzerland, at that time the home of a distinguished
school of glass painters. And the same may be said
of the glasses, though this is a point that has been somewhat
neglected until quite lately. Both the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">willkomm-humpen</span></i>
and the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">pass-gläser</span></i>—the broad and narrow
cylinders—found in Swiss and Bavarian collections are,
as a rule, much more carefully decorated than the quaint
but rude glasses of what we must vaguely call the
central district. Unfortunately we have no means of
more definitely determining the place of origin of the
latter class of beakers; in fact it may be said generally
of the glass made on both sides of the mountains that
encircle Bohemia, that there is little to distinguish the
productions of the different centres, however far apart
they may lie.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c001' >Now it is not too much to affirm that, as a whole,
the enamelling on German glass is in every way bad.
The colours are opaque; when not crude they are muddy
and dull. It is almost too high praise of them to say
that they look as if they had been painted on in oil-colours.
Take, for example, an average <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">adler-humpen</span></i>,
such a one as the big beaker in the British Museum
(Slade, No. 835). A mustardy yellow, that takes the
place of the gilding that is absent in the main painting,
is predominant; there is then an opaque blue,
crude and unpleasant, and a dull maroon, which—and
this is universally the case on these glasses—is the
nearest approach we get to red. Apart from these
colours we find only browns and drabs of undecided
tints. So much for the main decoration; but if we now
look carefully we find round the neck something that
takes us back to Venice—a delicate scale pattern of fine
powdered gold, and above this a line of beading with little
pearls of various colours. This band of exotic ornament
is seldom absent, at least in the earlier specimens.<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c018'><sup>[198]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_266' id='Page_266'>266</a></span>
There is no need to say much of the shapes of these
enamelled glasses, for they are almost invariably of a
more or less cylindrical form, with a foot of the simplest
character; covered glasses are comparatively rare. They
may be divided for our purpose into the broader beakers
(often with curved sides and sometimes of great capacity)
on the one hand, and on the other the narrower straight-sided
tall cylinders. Much ingenuity has been devoted
by German writers to the identification of the names by
which these glasses were known in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, and they have attempted to distinguish
between the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">spechter</span></i>, the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">bröderlein</span></i>, the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Krautstrunk</span></i>,
the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">pass-glas</span></i>, the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">humpen</span></i> and the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">willkomm</span></i>.
On the other hand, the term <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">wiederkomm</span></i> or <i>vidrecome</i>,
given by so many English and French writers to the
large broad forms, is unknown in Germany, so that I
think the expression may be definitely abandoned and
replaced by the word <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">humpen</span></i> or <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">willkomm humpen</span></i>.
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Narren-gläser</span></i>—fools’ glasses—says Mathesius, would be
a better name for these huge beakers that a man can
hardly lift. The tall, narrow cylindrical form, when
divided by horizontal lines, is known as a <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">pass-glas</span></i>.
The <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">spechter</span></i> of Mathesius has been identified with a
glass of this shape, sometimes decorated with square nail-headed
studs. These <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">spechter</span></i> came from the Spessart
forest district (west of Würzburg), and they form, as it
were, a link between the prunted green glass of the
Rhine and the enamelled beakers of Central Germany.</p>

<p class='c001' >There is a small group of enamelled glass of very
uncertain origin which claims attention here. We are
concerned with certain little ewers, either of colourless
or more often of deep cobalt-blue glass; they are
generally mounted in metal, but the handle is always
of glass. There are several examples of these ewers in
the British Museum, many of which bear dates ranging
from 1577 to 1618. The cobalt-blue glass has, by
Dr. Brinckmann, been traced back to the glass-houses
of Neudeck Platten, on the Saxon-Bohemian frontier. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_267' id='Page_267'>267</a></span>
the treatment, however, of the enamels on these little
jugs, we are reminded of some of the work executed by
the Altarists in France. The enamelling is of a somewhat
more pleasing character than that which we find
on the big beakers; white, yellow, green, and red are
applied without shading. A favourite subject is a stag-hunt
or the coursing of a hare, and at the side is often
found a graceful lily of the valley<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c018'><sup>[199]</sup></a> (<a href='#p40'>Plate <span class='fss'>XL.</span></a> 2).</p>

<p class='c001' >To return to our broad cylindrical glasses—the huge
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">humpen</span></i> and the smaller <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">kanne</span></i>, both of which indeed
sometimes take the form of a barrel or a truncated cone—it
is usual, on the basis of the decoration, to divide
these beakers into the following classes:—</p>

<p class='c001' >1. The <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Reichs-adler Humpen</span></i>. On these, the double-headed
eagle, displayed, with imperial crown, occupies
nearly the whole surface of the glass. A big crucifix
covers the breast of the bird, though this is replaced in
some examples by the ball of empire. The arms of the
seven electors and of the forty-eight members of the
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heilige Römische Reich</span></i> are arranged in a definite order
along the outstretched wing feathers<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c018'><sup>[200]</sup></a>(<a href='#p39'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXXIX.</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c001' >2. The <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kur-fürsten Humpen</span></i>. Here, on the upper
zone, the emperor on horseback rides in front of the
three spiritual electors—the four lay princes follow below.
In other cases the kaiser sits on his throne, with the
electors on either side.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c018'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >3. The Fichtelgebirge glasses, on which a mountain
landscape is rudely indicated. None of these glasses can
be attributed to an earlier date than the second half of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_268' id='Page_268'>268</a></span>
the seventeenth century. A good example in the British
Museum shows the Ochsenkopf, one of the highest peaks
of the district, as well as the four rivers that issue from
its slopes. A padlock hanging by a gold chain over the
mountain points to the treasures therein contained: as
an often-repeated inscription says:—<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">An Eisen, Erz und
Holz, thut mann viel von ihm ziehen</span></i>. Many of these
beakers, and perhaps others of a similar character, may
be referred to the glass-houses of Bischofsgrün, which
are situated at the foot of the Ochsenkopf.</p>

<p class='c001' >In spite of the crudity of the enamels and the rudeness
of the design, it is impossible to deny that there is
a certain attraction in the intensely German character of
the decoration on these three groups of glasses, which
thus form a class by themselves. They smack of the
soil and of the simple German folk who made them.
The earliest example known, an <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">adler-humpen</span></i>, is dated
1547, and differs little in the quality of the enamel from
the later specimens, which range down to the beginning
of the eighteenth century.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c018'><sup>[202]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >There are in the British Museum two remarkable
tankards which, though they do not fall under any of the
above divisions, may well be mentioned here. On one
we see an elaborate hunting scene: in the centre the net
is spread and the game is being driven in by dogs and
beaters (<a href='#p41'>Plate <span class='fss'>XLI</span>.</a>). On the other is a strangely crude
representation of the Last Supper, in the arrangement of
which, however, Leonardo’s famous design may still be
traced.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c001' >Before treating of the big glasses painted at Dresden
and of those of the South German school, I may well
say something of the second class of cylindrical vessels,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_269' id='Page_269'>269</a></span>
of which the most important sub-division is formed by
the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">pass-gläser</span></i>, the tall narrow beakers divided by
stringings of glass or by enamelled rings into a series
of zones. These glasses played an important part in the
drinking contests of the time. It would seem—to judge
from the lengthy verses, commencing and ending in all
cases with the word <i>vivat</i>, found on many of them—that
it was required of the drinker to swallow at one draught
the liquid contents of each zone, neither more nor less.
At other times the drinking was apparently regulated by
the dealing of cards. There is a remarkable example of
the typical <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">pass-glas</span></i> at South Kensington: it is divided
into twelve zones by quilled threadings of glass. The
simple decoration of hearts, roses, and wreaths, as well
as the long inscription, is painted in white enamel.</p>

<p class='c001' >A somewhat later group of enamelled glasses may
be traced to Dresden, to the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hof-kellerei</span></i> of the Saxon
electors, whose arms these glasses bear. The painting
on them, though of no great artistic merit, is somewhat
less rude, more ‘urbane,’ in fact, than that on the previous
examples. They form, indeed, a transition to the carefully
executed Nuremberg glasses. There are several
examples of these Saxon beakers in the British Museum.
A fine covered <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">willkomm</span></i> (Slade, No. 843) bears the
portrait of the elector John George as well as of the four
Saxon dukes, all booted and spurred, and with plumed
hats on their heads. This beaker is dated 1656, the year
of the elector’s death. Another, a <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">pass-glas</span></i> (Slade, No.
847), has the arms and initials of Augustus the Strong,
king of Poland (1697-1733); the four zones into which
this glass is divided, each holding about half a pint, are
indicated by numerals, calling to mind, says Mr. Nesbitt,
the peg tankards of the sixteenth century. Another
example, dated 1658, also from the Slade collection
(No. 851), a goblet with the arms of the elector of
Saxony, encircled by the garter, is remarkable for the
glass being externally striped with opaque white bands
in obvious imitation of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetro di trina</span></i>. There is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_270' id='Page_270'>270</a></span>
somewhat obscure reference to German glass so decorated
in the often-quoted sermon of Mathesius, and of this
passage much has been made by German writers.<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c018'><sup>[203]</sup></a> I
doubt whether the imitation was in any case more than
superficial, and I do not think that, at least before the
middle of the seventeenth century, any example of
German glass can be pointed to which is really built
up with rods as in the case of the true Venetian lace
glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >There is a large class of painted beakers on which the
decoration has reference to the occupation of the original
owner, and among these the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">zunft-becher</span></i>, the guild or
corporation glasses, hold an important place. These
glasses date, without exception, from a comparatively late
time, when among the upper classes the new engraved
crystal glass had taken the place of the enamelled
ware; already by the end of the seventeenth century the
latter had come to be regarded as somewhat <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeois</span></i> in
character. However that may be, these <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">humpen</span></i> bearing
the arms of the guilds and quaint representations of the
trades and industries are among the most interesting of
their class. Many of these <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Innungs gläser</span></i> are still
preserved in the halls of the trade guilds. Herr von
Czihak mentions several instances of this in Breslau and
other Silesian towns.</p>

<p class='c001' >In Southern Germany the Venetian influence was not
only more early felt, but, what is of greater importance,
it continued in play for a longer time, being continually
renewed by fresh importations of the Italian glass. The
art-loving dukes of Bavaria, Albrecht <span class='fss'>V.</span> and his successor
Wilhelm <span class='fss'>V.</span>, in the second half of the sixteenth
century, did much to promote the manufacture of glass
on improved methods. Strangely enough, however, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_271' id='Page_271'>271</a></span>
find that it was from Antwerp, not from Italy, that the
assistance came in the first case; and it was to compete
with Italian glass imported from Venice <em>by way of
Antwerp</em> that Bernhart Schwarz, a glass-maker of the
latter town, erected a furnace—at Landshut, on the Isar.
Scarpaggiato, the Venetian, who came later, was engaged,
in the first place, to make window-glass and mirrors. He
is stated, however, to have been a master of the art of
making <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vasi a reticelli</span></i> and <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">a ritorti</span></i> of both white and
coloured glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >At Hall, near Innsbruck, some remarkable imitations
of Venetian glass were made in the third quarter of the
sixteenth century. In the Imperial Museum at Vienna
there are many specimens of this Tyrolese glass, much
of it scratched with the diamond and heavily gilt. There
may be seen a goblet made by the art-loving Archduke
Ferdinand, the husband of Philippine Welser.</p>

<p class='c001' >As I have already said, it was in the towns of South
Germany—Swabian and Ducal Bavarian—as well as
in Switzerland, that the new art of painting window-glass
with enamel colours was carried to the highest
perfection, and we can trace the influence of this school
of painters upon the decoration of the enamelled beakers
preserved in the museums of Zürich, Munich, Augsburg,
and other South German and Swiss cities. But it is
to the Franconian Nuremberg, which, though further to
the north, fell under the same influences, that we must
turn to find the most brilliant work of this southern
school. Here we come upon the family of the Hirschvogels,
so many of whom during the course of the
seventeenth century were famed as designers of glass for
windows, and we have evidence from documents that
have been preserved that the younger members at least
of the family painted on drinking-glasses with enamel
colours (Friedrich, <cite>Alt-Deutsche Gläser</cite>, p. 157).</p>

<p class='c001' >It is chiefly on the ground of the coats-of-arms found
on a few examples that we are enabled to attribute to
Nuremberg artists a variety of enamelled glass which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_272' id='Page_272'>272</a></span>
differs in many respects from the heavily painted <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">humpen</span></i>
and <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">pass</span></i> glasses of which I have been speaking. In
the British Museum may be seen certain tall cylindrical
beakers which may be taken as examples of this South
German glass. The metal is colourless but somewhat
grey, and, as in the northern glasses, a delicate scale
pattern of gold with scattered pearls of enamel forms a
ring below the upper margin. But now we find the gold
used freely in the rest of the decoration also, replacing
the coarse yellow enamel of the northern beakers. The
colours are purer and more effectively combined, and we
see among them a green of good quality. In the case of
the two beakers from the Slade collection in the British
Museum, the figure of Jacob Praun on one glass, on the
other that of his wife, stand detached in the field; there
is no other decoration apart from the heraldic bearings
of this Nuremberg family (these are on the other side of
the glass) and the above-mentioned gold band. I may
add that the Nuremberg enamellers showed a superlative
skill in the treatment of these elaborate coats-of-arms
backed with fluttering mantlings.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of the larger <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">humpen</span></i> and <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">pass</span></i> glasses painted with
allegorical or sometimes comic subjects, we have no good
examples in our English collections. A beaker in the
Germanic Museum at Nuremberg, showing the ten ages
of man in as many compartments, is an exceptionally
good example of such work. The drawing and composition
of the subjects on these larger South German
glasses are carefully carried out—the colouring, however,
is generally poor; in the later examples, indeed, it tends
to pass over to the monochrome or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grisaille</span></i> class, of
which I must say a word before finishing with these
enamelled wares.</p>

<p class='c001' >The school of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grisaille</span></i> painters on drinking-glasses,
founded towards the middle of the seventeenth century
by Johann Schaper, is in many ways closely associated
with the contemporary engravers on glass. Like the
latter, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grisaille</span></i> painters followed the pseudo-classical,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_273' id='Page_273'>273</a></span>
the ‘Italianising’ style, rather than the old German
traditions. Schaper, who came from Harburg on the
Elbe, settled in Nuremberg in 1640, and died there in
1670. His manner of work, founded on copper-plate
engravings, was much admired at the time, and he is
in the next century mentioned among the famous artists
of Nuremberg by Doppelmayr in his <cite>Nachricht von den
Nürnbergischen Künstlern</cite>. Schaper, he says, ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">auf die
Trinkgläser ... gar delicat mahlte</span></i>,’ burning in his
work afterwards so successfully that he surpassed all his
contemporaries. He painted—round the sides of small
tumblers and wine-glasses, for the most part—landscapes,
figures, and heraldic bearings, either in black or a warm
sepia, signing his work with his initials. There are some
small examples of the glass enamelled by him at South
Kensington. The large goblet in the British Museum
(Slade, No. 860), painted with a cavalry combat, is of
a considerably later date, but it shows that Schaper’s
influence continued into the eighteenth century; in this
case, however, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grisaille</span></i> is heightened in places by
touches of colour. The tall <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">pass</span></i>-glass (Slade, No. 859),
painted with an elaborate procession celebrating the birth
of a Bavarian prince, belongs, on the other hand, to quite
another school. It is dated 1662, and Schaper’s influence
had probably not reached Munich by that time.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Painted and Gilt Glass</span></h3>

<p class='c001' >Before passing on to the many-sided subject of engraved
and cut glass, a word must be said of certain
applications to glass of painting and gilding which were
much in favour in Germany in the seventeenth century.
I have here to deal with a miscellaneous class of objects;
indeed the chief connecting-link between them is the fact
that the decoration is in no case fixed by fire.</p>

<p class='c001' >Single sheets of glass may be simply painted at the
back, and ‘fixed’ by means of a transparent varnish.
Such plates, painted with Biblical or allegorical subjects,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_274' id='Page_274'>274</a></span>
may be seen let into the panels of the elaborately carved
and inlaid cabinets of the time. It cannot be said that
the effect of this <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">pausch glas Malerei</span></i>, as it is sometimes
called in Germany, is very satisfactory. It is indeed
merely a debased variety of what used to be known in
France as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre églomisé</span></i>; the term <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fixé peint</span></i> has also
been used for work of this kind.</p>

<p class='c001' >The gilding that was so plentifully applied to the
German engraved glass of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries was fixed by a ‘cold’ process, by simply attaching
the gold-leaf by means of a varnish. For the most
part it is only when applied to the sunk part of an <i>incavo</i>
decoration that this gilding has survived.</p>

<p class='c001' >The gilding, however, has been more effectually preserved
in the case of another cold process which came
into vogue before the end of the seventeenth century, and
rapidly spread from Bohemia, or perhaps rather from
Silesia, to various parts of Germany. In the case of these
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">zwischen gläser</span></i> we are taken back to an old process, already
known to the Alexandrian Greeks. The plan adopted in
no way differs in principle from that made use of in the
decoration of the beautiful bowls from Canosa, now in the
British Museum (see p. <a href='#Page_46'>46</a>).<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c018'><sup>[204]</sup></a> Very inferior to these in
artistic merit are the little footless tumblers, with designs
in gold, often hunting scenes, which seem to have been
made on both sides of the Silesian-Bohemian frontier
before the end of the seventeenth century. These are
built up of two glasses, both somewhat tapering and
both cut into an equal number of perpendicular sides, so
that when the smaller of the two was inserted into the
interior of the larger the glasses fitted exactly, and could
not rotate one upon the other. The inner glass being
somewhat the taller, we find the ring of junction, which
is generally concealed by a band of gold, about half an
inch or so below the top of the glass. The edges are so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_275' id='Page_275'>275</a></span>
exactly bevelled that this line of junction is barely perceptible
even to the touch. Before fitting the two glasses
together, the inner one had been coated on the outside
with gold-leaf, and the design carefully engraved on the
gold with a steel point; while on the inside of the outer
glass a coating of old linseed oil or of varnish had been
smeared. I should add that a medallion of ruby glass,
variously ornamented, is usually found at the bottom of
these tumblers inserted between the two layers of glass,
or sometimes replacing the base of the outer cylinder.
These glasses will not stand warm liquids: an example
in the British Museum is disfigured by some large
flattened blisters, probably the result of heat.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c018'><sup>[205]</sup></a> Glasses
built up in this manner may of course be decorated in
other ways; the gold-leaf, for instance, may be replaced
by silver foil. Kunckel, of ruby-glass fame, describes a
method in which the inner glass is plainly gilt, while the
outer one is painted on the inside in imitation of precious
marbles (<cite>Ars Vitraria Experimentalis</cite>, 1679). I have
seen examples of this manner of decoration in German
museums.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_8 c006'     >I have still to describe the origin and development
of a method of decorating the surface which forms,
I may almost say, the last main division in the
artistic history of glass. For when I come in subsequent
chapters to treat of Dutch and English glass—and with
this my task practically closes—it will be found that this
glass falls almost entirely under the head, and is in a
general way an outcome, of the engraved or cut glass of
Germany.</p>

<p class='c001' >Here at the beginning I am confronted with a difficulty
of a class only too often met with when treating of
the technique of the minor arts—the difficulty of finding
in our language suitable words to express, without danger
of misconception and confusion, the practical details of
the matter in hand. I have now to deal with the
methods by which the surface of glass may be cut,
polished, scraped, or eaten away, so as to form an
artistic design. This, I may say at once, can be effected
by any one of the following methods:—</p>

<p class='c001' >1. By <em>scratching</em> with a diamond. I can find no
other word; the term ‘engraving’ is vague and ambiguous;
to use the word ‘etching’ is still worse, for
though the result resembles in a measure the etched line
on copper, this expression should be reserved for the
process by which the surface is eaten away (the German
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">ätzen</span></i>) by acid.</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_277' id='Page_277'>277</a></span>
2. By removing the surface by means of a small
revolving wheel, or more rarely, of a cutting-tool, with
the aid of emery or other hard powdered stone. The
term ‘engraving’ may well be used here, if it is understood
in the sense in which we speak of an ‘engraved
gem,’ for small hard stones have been cut in this way
from ancient times.</p>

<p class='c001' >3. When, however, by means of a large wheel, the
surface is deeply cut away, we may better use the words
‘cutting’ or ‘carving.’ The grinding down of the surface
and subsequent polishing, as in the case of glass cut into
facets, would fall into this division. It is, however, often
difficult to say which of these terms—engraving, cutting,
or grinding—it is preferable to use; nor is the use of the
German words ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">schleifen</span></i>’ and ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">schneiden</span></i>’ much more
definite.</p>

<p class='c001' >4. By exposing parts of the surface to the fumes of
hydrofluoric acid, the only acid that will attack glass.
This process may well be called etching.</p>

<p class='c001' >We have already spoken of the use of the diamond
by the Venetians for scratching lace-like designs upon
the surface of their thin glass, so unsuitable for other
forms of engraving. The diamond point was early used
in a similar way in Germany. Mathesius, after speaking
of the imitations of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetro di trina</span></i>, made in his day
in Silesia, proceeds to say that it is also the practice
to draw (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">reissen</span></i>) ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">auf die schönen und glatten Venedischen
gleser mit demand</span></i> [diamond] <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">allerley laubwerck
und schöne züge</span></i>.’</p>

<p class='c001' >This decoration with the diamond point was carried
to great perfection in Silesia. Herr von Czihak has reproduced
in his work on the glass of that country
(p. <a href='#Page_122'>122</a>) two tall cylinders of this ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">gerissene glas</span></i>’ (so
it is called in contemporary inventories), which cannot
be later than the sixteenth century. So, again, much of
the glass of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> type made at Hall in the Tyrol was
thus decorated.</p>

<p class='c001' >But this process of drawing designs with a diamond
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_278' id='Page_278'>278</a></span>
point on the surface of glass required the sure hand of
an artist; there was no room for any ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">pentimenti</span></i>’—moreover,
the result was not effective.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c018'><sup>[206]</sup></a> Before long, in
Germany at least, except here and there by amateurs, it
came to be used merely as supplementary to the newly
introduced processes of cutting, engraving, and polishing—that
is to say, to the combination of methods concisely
indicated by the Germans as <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">schliff und schnitt</span></i>. This
was, indeed, a return to a very old treatment of the
material much in favour in later Roman times. We
have recognised in the so-called Hedwig glasses the
last efforts of an art already extinct in the West and
decadent in the East; but we have no link with which
to connect these rude, deeply carved goblets with the
engraved glass of the German renaissance. The
Germans were, indeed, familiar with the processes employed
in polishing the surfaces of hard stones, especially
of their native agates (as in the Hunsrück district).
This they effected in early days by rubbing on a board,
the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">schleif-platte</span></i>, and already by the middle of the
fifteenth century by means of a grindstone (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">schleif-stein</span></i>)
turned by water-power. There is, however, no
evidence to connect this industry with the new art of
engraving glass, which arose, it would seem, full-fledged
at Prague and at Nuremberg just before the commencement
of the seventeenth century.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c018'><sup>[207]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >There is, indeed, every reason to accept the origin of
this art given by contemporary writers—that it was learned
from the Italian carvers of rock crystal, who in the last
years of the sixteenth century were working for the
Emperor Rudolph <span class='fss'>II.</span>, that moody recluse and most unsatisfactory
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_279' id='Page_279'>279</a></span>
ruler, who was, however, an eager and
industrious inquirer into all the new arts and sciences
of the day. This essentially <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cinquecento</span></i> art of carving
in rock crystal had been before this time carried to great
perfection in the north of Italy. The most famous
master was Valerio Belli (1479-1546), called Vicentino,
from his birthplace. The finest work of this school is
to be found in the caskets built up with plates of rock-crystal
delicately carved in shallow intaglio.<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c018'><sup>[208]</sup></a> Other
artists carved in the round bowls and vases in the form
of shells or other shapes, suggested, in the first place, by
the outline of the original mass of crystal. If these men
were in any way indebted to Greek artists from Constantinople
or elsewhere, it can only have been for the
knowledge of the mechanical processes, for there is no
trace of Byzantine influence in their art. To judge by
surviving examples, it was in the main the work carved
in the round that found favour at the court of Rudolph <span class='fss'>II.</span>
We hear especially of two craftsmen from Milan,
Girolamo and Caspare Miseroni, who worked for that
prince.</p>

<p class='c001' >As what we know of the early history of cutting and
engraving on glass in Germany is chiefly derived from
Sandrart’s famous work on the lives of German artists, I
will here translate, with considerable abbreviations in
places, what he says on this subject (<cite>Teutsche Academie</cite>,
Nürnberg, 1675, Part <span class='fss'>II.</span> book iii. chap. xxiv.).—It
was during the reign of the most worthy Emperor
Rudolph <span class='fss'>II.</span> that the art of cutting glass was rediscovered
and made public by Caspar Lehmann, <cite>Cammer-Edelstein
und Glas-Schneider</cite> to his majesty. The emperor
rewarded him richly for his discovery, and in the year
1609, at Prague, granted him certain privileges in a
diploma which has been preserved:—‘Let all men know
that our privy-precious-stone and glass-cutter Caspar
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_280' id='Page_280'>280</a></span>
Lehmann has informed us, that now some years since,
with great strivings, with busy reflection, and not trifling
cost, he discovered the art and practice of glass-cutting.
And let it be known that the same C. L. shall have full
liberty to carry on his art and work free and without let;
and that no one, whoever he be, shall, without his consent,
practise or deal in such art or work. And we
request all the Electors, Princes, etc. etc., of the Empire
to punish any infraction of this privilege with a fine of
twenty marks of gold of true alloy.’</p>

<p class='c001' >Lehmann, indeed, continues Sandrart, well deserved
these privileges. Both he and his comrade Zacharias
Belzer (they were both friends of Hans von Achen and
Paul von Vianen, and for the most part they were lodged
at court in one apartment) executed such excellent and
artistic works in crystal and glass (some of which are
still preserved in the Imperial Schatzkammer and also
in the palace of the Elector at Munich) that they command
the admiration of all connoisseurs.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c018'><sup>[209]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >George Schwanhart the elder, says Sandrart, was the
son of Johann, a skilful cabinet-maker and armourer, who
made, among other things, exceptionally beautiful inlaid
work of mother-of-pearl. George, who in his youth had
learned cabinet-making and other arts from his father,
acquired from the above-mentioned Lehmann a thorough
acquaintance with the new art of glass-cutting. So
much was he loved by Lehmann on account of his
ingenious parts that the latter, before his death, bequeathed
to him his privileges and rights as well as other
property.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c018'><sup>[210]</sup></a> Schwanhart, after this time, further cultivated
the art and much advanced it by various inventions,
especially by the new ‘smooth or polished cutting’
(<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">hellen oder blancken schneiden</span></i>). His industry and skill
obtained for him the praise and love of emperor, kings,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_281' id='Page_281'>281</a></span>
and princes, as well as of all those who cultivated the arts
and sciences. The late Emperor (Ferdinand <span class='fss'>III.</span>, 1637-1658)
continued these privileges to his sons, Henry and
George the younger, and gave to both of them appointments
at court.</p>

<p class='c001' >Now although, continues Sandrart, these artists had
brought to perfection the art of glass-cutting as far as it
depended upon judgment and drawing, yet in consequence
of the too powerful and clumsy machinery made
use of by them, even they were unable to give grace and
charm to their work. When we consider the big heavy
wheels that they were fain to employ—turned by those
still flourishing weeds, their loutish assistants—we may
well marvel at the work they turned out. Since that time
the discovery of more convenient and efficient tools has
brought it about that nowadays the art of glass-cutting
is no longer a strenuous task, but rather a pastime. So
that with intelligence and industry all the charm and
softness of nature, whether trees, landscapes, animals, or
portraits, may be by this art expressed. And yet these
glass-cutters of to-day, with all their advantages, might
obtain from their patrons still greater praise, were they
to devote themselves more to the practice of drawing and
to travelling about instead of marrying early and, as
a consequence, having to work in the kitchen.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c018'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Henry Schwanhart—I am still dependent upon Sandrart—who
with his brother George inherited his father’s
privileges, has not only distinguished himself as a philosopher
and a poet, but has carried the art of glass-cutting
to greater perfection. He has succeeded in tracing on
glass, landscapes and complete views of towns—the city
of Nuremberg above all—in correct proportion and
cunningly retiring perspective, as in a painted picture.
Nay, with his subtle wit he has done what before was
held to be an impossibility, he has discovered an acid
(<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">corrosiv</span></i>) of such a nature that the hardest crystalline
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_282' id='Page_282'>282</a></span>
glass yields to it, and like metals and stones, suffers
itself to be corroded and eaten into.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c018'><sup>[212]</sup></a> He has quite
lately given a complete proof of his skill in this art by
etching all kinds of ornamental designs and inscriptions
with the greatest neatness and precision. He has
engraved, too, the human figure both nude and draped,
and has brought it, as well as all kinds of animals

gebracht</span></i>).<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c018'><sup>[213]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >So far Sandrart, who was a contemporary of the
younger Schwanhart, and I think that this long extract
will give the reader some idea of the high esteem in
which the art of engraving on glass was held at that
time, as well as of the relation of the glass-engravers
to the workers in other branches of art. The works of
the Schwanharts are now, I believe, only to be identified
in the case of certain examples of engraved glass in the
Museum at Hamburg. Here may be seen a <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemer</span></i>,
signed ‘G. S. 1660.’ The delicately engraved landscape
on this glass, where the work of the diamond and that of
the finest wheel are skilfully combined, would point to
this being probably the work of the younger of the two
Georges.</p>

<p class='c001' >That even before the end of the sixteenth century
there were engravers of glass in other parts of Germany,
above all in Silesia, is very probable, but there can be no
doubt that it was the connection of Lehmann and of the
Schwanharts with the Imperial Court that first brought
this style of decoration into favour with people in high
station. In fact, for some time this engraved glass was
made for the most part to the order of wealthy patrons.
Besides those named by Sandrart, the Archbishop-Elector
of Mainz and the Bishops of Würzburg and
Bamberg are mentioned as patrons of the new art, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_283' id='Page_283'>283</a></span>
large prices were given for fine specimens of engraving.<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c018'><sup>[214]</sup></a>
One immediate consequence of the new fashion was to
cause a demand for an absolutely clear white glass, and
this led to such improvements in the manufacture that
the glass of Silesia and Bohemia was soon recognised as
the best in Europe.</p>

<p class='c001' >From other sources we hear that George Schwanhart
the elder had three daughters, Sophia, Maria, and
Suzanna, who devoted themselves to the engraving on
glass of flowers and ornaments, and especially of those
examples of calligraphy then so much in fashion. Sandrart,
most ungallantly, fails to mention these ladies, who
were his contemporaries.</p>

<p class='c001' >Many other names of engravers on glass have been
handed down to us,<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c018'><sup>[215]</sup></a> but I will only mention Hermann
Schwinger (1640-83), who was also a wood-carver and
engraver on copper. We have in the British Museum
(Slade, No. 883) a tall cup of thin white glass elaborately
engraved with a Bacchic subject. Below, scratched by
the diamond in small characters, may be read ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Herman
Schwinger, cristall schnider zu Nürnberg</span></i>.’</p>

<p class='c001' >There has been much discussion as to the nature of
the improvements effected by the Schwanharts in the
glass-cutting machinery. But before the end of the
seventeenth century the arrangement of the wheels and
the division of labour were probably on the whole established
much in the manner that we find in local works in
Bohemia at the present day. In a general way we may
say that there has always been a distinction between the
mechanical processes of grinding and polishing and the
more delicate and artistic work of the engraver. In the
latter case the work is done by pressing the glass
against the edge of a minute copper wheel. On the other
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_284' id='Page_284'>284</a></span>
hand, the glass is ground down on a wheel of iron from
three to eighteen inches in diameter, it is smoothed
upon a stone wheel and finally polished upon one of
wood, with the assistance in each case of suitable
abrading mediums, whether emery, quartz sand, tripoli,
or putty-powder.</p>

<p class='c001' >As early as the seventeenth century these <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">glas-schleifer</span></i>
were divided into several more or less independent
groups. The <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">eckigräber</span></i> did the coarser work. It
fell to them, in the first place, to remove all irregularities
on the surface of the glass—for example, the rough projections
left on the foot where the pontil had been attached—and
more especially to make the cross cuttings required
to form the facets, which at a later time were so much in
vogue. The <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">kugler</span></i> were another class of workmen, who
prepared the shallow circular or oval pits which play so
important a part in the decoration.</p>

<p class='c001' >The work of the actual engraver belongs more to the
domain of art. The cutting in this case is effected by
a little wheel of copper from a quarter inch to an inch
in diameter, revolving rapidly at the end of a horizontal
spindle, moved by a treadle. These little copper wheels
are of various forms, and not the least part of the skill
of the artist lies in the selection of the form most suitable
for the work in hand. The decision as to the depth of
the engraved line, and again as to which part should be
polished and which left dull depends also upon his
judgment. His difficulties are increased by the fact that
he is unable to follow the progress of the work in hand,
for not only has he to press the glass against the under
surface of the wheel, but the part of the surface on which
he is working remains covered by the emery or other
abrading material employed (Von Czihak, pp. 136-139).
It will be noticed that as a rule the incised parts are left
unpolished and dull as they come from the wheel, and
that the polishing is reserved for the little circular depressions,
the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">kugeln</span></i>, which then show out like jewels
cut <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_285' id='Page_285'>285</a></span>
We are apt to associate this engraved glass with
Bohemia, but to say nothing of the highly finished and
artistic work done at Nuremberg and Regensburg, it is
probable that in no other district has the engraving and
cutting of glass become so much a distinct industry as in
the Silesian valleys that descend from the highest peaks
of the Riesengebirge towards the town of Hirschberg.
As early as the commencement of the seventeenth century
we come across an Italian engraver on rock crystal in
the service of the Freiherr von Schaffgotsch at Schloss
Kynast, and at the same spot towards the end of the
century, in the employ of the same family, we find
Friedrich Winter, who has the credit of being the first
in this district to apply water-power to the cutting and
polishing of glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >Soon after this time there are many complaints of
the decadence and vulgarisation of the art. Thus in
1708 a writer in a commercial paper complains that the
engraved glass, which formerly was only to be found on
the table of people of quality, had now become ‘dirt-cheap,’
and that the art of the glass-cutter was brought
into contempt by the hawkers of glasses who scoured
nearly the whole of Europe with their engraved wares.
Whole chestsful of these commoner glasses, the writer
says, were sent to Spain, and found there a good market
(quoted by Von Czihak, p. 129). Sandrart, it will be
remembered, some years before this, had uttered a protest
against the <i>stimpler</i>—the bungling, ignorant workmen—who
were ruining the art, and now we find the same
expression used in the diploma of the monopoly that
was granted to the above-mentioned Winter in 1687 by
Count Christoph Leopold of Silesia.</p>

<p class='c001' >Thanks in a measure to the energy of Winter and to
the support given to him, the little town of Warmbrunn
soon became known all through Germany as well for its
cut glass as for the warm springs to which it owed its
name. As in other parts of Silesia, the glass industry,
after the separation from Bohemia, suffered from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_286' id='Page_286'>286</a></span>
fiscal regulations of the new Prussian régime. Frederick
the Great took an interest in the manufacture of glass,
but this was shown rather in the encouragement and
patronage accorded to the new glass-works that had
been established nearer to his capital.</p>

<p class='c001' >On the other side of the mountains also, at the end
of the seventeenth century, some of the great Bohemian
landholders were active in promoting the manufacture
of glass on their estates. Of the Kinsky family and the
town of Steinschönau (even to-day a great centre of the
glass industry), we hear something in the curious account
of his life left by a wandering glass-cutter, one Kreybich,
who was born in that town in 1662. Kreybich, who had
mastered the arts both of enamelling and engraving
glass, carried his wares on his barrow all over Southern
Germany. In his later journeys he pushed forward as
far as Poland and Russia. As early as 1688 he is found
in London, where, in spite of the competition of many new
glass-furnaces (these, he confesses, turned out better metal
than that which he had with him), he found a good
demand for his engraved glass. When the wandering
retailers of glass—we can hardly call them hawkers—returned
to renew their supplies, then, says Kreybich,
there was an eager demand from the glass-houses, and
no less from the glass-cutters, the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">kugler</span></i>, and the
polishers. But not a few of these wandering glassmen
carried, it would seem, their engraving-wheel and their
tools with them, and engraved on the spot the arms or the
initials of the purchasers of their glasses.</p>

<p class='c001' >We may indeed regard the first half of the eighteenth
century as the most flourishing period of the glass
industry in Bohemia and Silesia. At the end of that
time the Bohemian town of Haida—at the present day the
centre of more than one branch of the glass manufacture—rose
to importance, thanks to the fostering care of Count
Kinsky. But the industrial and commercial element
now came more and more to prevail. Enterprising
manufacturers like Franz Weidlich of Steinschönau exported
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_287' id='Page_287'>287</a></span>
to Spain and Portugal, and others supplied the
Eastern market as far as the Indies with glass summarily
decorated with ‘little wreaths cut with a small copper
wheel with the aid of emery.’ This Eastern trade passed
through Vienna, and meeting with every encouragement
from Maria Theresa and from Joseph <span class='fss'>II.</span>, soon undermined
the time-honoured monopoly of the Venetians in
the Levant and in Persia. With the Western market
it was otherwise. The German glass had to reach the
Peninsula by way of the Flemish ports, Antwerp and
Ostend. What we have known as the Spanish Netherlands
were now in Austrian hands, and the new government
was eager to promote the local industries. The
energetic firm of the Bonhommes (see p. <a href='#Page_242'>242</a>), long
established at Liége and other neighbouring towns, competed
successfully first with the German and then with
the English glass-makers, just as formerly they had
competed with the Italians, adopting in turn the methods
of each.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c018'><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019' >But in addition to cutting or engraving with a wheel
and scratching with a diamond, there is a third method
by which the surface of glass may be removed. This is
by means of hydrofluoric acid, the only re-agent by which
glass is rapidly attacked. The discovery of this acid
is usually ascribed to Scheele, the Swedish chemist
(born 1742), and a date as late as 1771 is given to the
discovery. But there is no doubt that the special virtues
of the fumes that are given off when fluor-spar is heated
in sulphuric acid were known before this time.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c018'><sup>[217]</sup></a> We
have seen how Sandrart, writing before 1675, mentions
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_288' id='Page_288'>288</a></span>
that his contemporary Henry Schwanhart engraved glass
by means of a ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">corrosiv</span></i>,’ and the statement is repeated
with picturesque details by Doppelmayr. By covering
part of the glass with a varnish and exposing the rest
to these acid fumes, Schwanhart produced a smooth
pattern on a dead ground. Certain calligraphic inscriptions
on plates of glass, preserved in German museums,<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c018'><sup>[218]</sup></a>
were probably engraved in this way, but at the time
the process did not come into general use. At a much
later period hydrofluoric acid has been largely employed
in England and elsewhere for engraving on glass. Still
more recently this method has given way to the sand-blast.
These are both, however, purely industrial
processes that have little to do with art.</p>

<p class='c019' >We have seen how close was the relation in early
mediæval times between the quest of the alchemist and
the art of the glass-maker—that part of the art above
all that was concerned with the production of coloured
pastes. So again at the end of the seventeenth century,
when the search for the philosopher’s stone, the universal
medicine and other such nostrums, had again come into
vogue in Germany, the glass-maker’s craft is once
more found in close relation with these ambiguous
researches. This intimate connection is well illustrated
in the history of Johann Kunckel, a man whose career
in more than one aspect reminds us of that of Böttger,
the discoverer of the secret of making porcelain. Böttger
may indeed be regarded as Kunckel’s successor at
Meissen and Dresden, for both for a time held official
positions as alchemist or arcanist at the Saxon court.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c018'><sup>[219]</sup></a>
Kunckel was born in 1638 (or perhaps somewhat sooner)
in the duchy of Schleswig. At an early age we find
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_289' id='Page_289'>289</a></span>
him in the service of the Saxon Elector engaged in the
search for the philosopher’s stone. He lectured, too, on
chemistry at Wittenberg before a numerous audience.
After the year 1677 he entered the service of Frederick
William, the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grosse Churfürst</span></i>. It was at Berlin about
this time that his researches upon the transformation of
matter led him to make inquiries into the colouring
of glass, above all into the mysterious process by which
glass could be stained of a crimson or purple tint by
means of gold. That such a colour could be thus
obtained had long been a tradition among the alchemists.
In the old books the secret was dangled before the eyes
of the student without being fully explained. The
Saracens were probably acquainted with it; Agricola
mentions the <i>ritzle</i>, the ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurum quo tingitur vitrum
rubro colore</span></i>,’ and Neri refers to the red tint derived from
gold.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c018'><sup>[220]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Not a little of the mystery that so long surrounded
this ruby colour had its origin, no doubt, in the following
facts:—1. The full tint is only to be got when an
extremely minute quantity of gold is present. 2. The
colour is not developed until the glass is reheated; on
first cooling the metal is nearly colourless. It is
scarcely necessary to point out how both these properties
of the gold pigment must have appealed to the imagination
of the alchemists, and have furnished them with
arguments in favour of their transformation theories.
Here, then, we have one explanation of the interest
taken by these early inquirers in the processes of the
glass-maker.</p>

<p class='c001' >In 1679 Kunckel published his <cite>Ars Vitraria Experimentalis</cite>,
a work which is indeed merely a retranslation
into German of Merret’s edition of Neri (see p. <a href='#Page_219'>219</a>), with
supplementary notes.<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c018'><sup>[221]</sup></a> Not that Kunckel here fully
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_290' id='Page_290'>290</a></span>
discloses the secret of his famous ruby glass—he draws
back at the last moment. Orschall, however, his rival,
a man of whom we are told that ‘he took to polygamy
and other irregularities, and died in a monastery in
Poland,’ in his famous tractate <cite>Sol sine Veste</cite>, first
printed in 1684, is somewhat more explicit. <i>A propos</i>
of his experiments with certain ‘handsome vases in the
style of porcelain,’ he tells us that the milkiness of the
glass with which the Oriental porcelain was imitated was
only developed on reheating, and the same, he mentions,
is the case with <em>the ruby colour of the glass containing
gold</em>.<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c018'><sup>[222]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Kunckel was settled by the Great Elector on the
Pfauen-Insel, near Potsdam, and it was in the glass-houses
already erected on the island that, surrounded
with the greatest secrecy, he first made his famous ruby
glass. After a time, however, constrained by what he
calls ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">die lüderliche Verkrämerung des Rubin-Flusses</span></i>,’
otherwise by lack of gold, he passed over to the service
of the Swedish king. He died at Stockholm as Baron
Löwenstjern in 1702.</p>

<p class='c001' >Kunckel’s name has become attached to certain large
ewers and beakers of ruby glass. He made, too, glass of
a deep emerald tint, but specimens of this are rare.
Some of his glasses—and these are perhaps the oldest—are
carved in high relief; others are blown with great
technical skill. Large sums were given at the time for
examples of his work. The vases of blown glass took on
classical forms, and were set in scroll mountings of silver
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_291' id='Page_291'>291</a></span>
gilt. But these mounted pieces are for the most part of
later date than Kunckel’s time, for glass of this kind was
made at Zechlin and other places near Berlin up to the
middle of the eighteenth century and perhaps later. A
tankard of ruby glass in the British Museum (Slade, No.
869) bears the cipher of Frederick <span class='fss'>I.</span> (1701-1713); in the
same collection is another fine example (Slade, No. 868),
a graceful ewer, set in a rococo silver-gilt mounting.<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c018'><sup>[223]</sup></a>
Among other specimens of this ruby glass in Lord
Rothschild’s collection is a tumbler-shaped beaker,
‘frosted’ on the outside.</p>

<p class='c001' >As in the case of the porcelain made at a later time in
Berlin, the Prussian glass as a whole is distinguished by
its technical excellence and, compared at least to the
bulk of the contemporary work, by a certain severity of
form and decoration.</p>

<p class='c001' >Much opaque white glass was made in Germany, as
in other countries, in the first years of the eighteenth
century. By this means it was hoped to find an equivalent
for the Oriental porcelain, which had not yet been
successfully imitated. At South Kensington may be
seen a covered beaker of this <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">milch-glas</span></i> elaborately
painted with a baroque design; more often, however, the
decoration on such ware is in a pseudo-Chinese style.
Von Czihak has extracted from the contemporary work
of a certain Kundmann, a learned doctor and dilettante,
a recipe for making this glass with human bones; this
formula, the author states, he obtained from Kunckel
(<cite>Rariora Naturæ et Artis.</cite> Breslau, 1737). Kundmann
claims for this glass, prepared from bones found in
heathen burial-urns, that it surpassed in whiteness the
best porcelain. On one of his glasses preserved in the
museum at Breslau, there is a quaint Latin inscription.
You are asked to offer a libation to those poor heathens
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_292' id='Page_292'>292</a></span>
for whom, after suffering both on the field of battle and
in the furnace of the glass-maker, the pains of hell are
reserved. Kundmann had too, in his cabinet, some little
glasses on which were engraved the tobacco-plant and
other designs relating to smoking. These, he declared,
were prepared solely from sand and tobacco ash (<cite>Schlesische
Gläser</cite>, p. 62).</p>

<p class='c001' >There is one important branch of the Bohemian-Silesian
glass industry, of which before ending a word
must be said. This is the manufacture of beads and
other kinds of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i>, as well as of glass pastes for
artificial jewellery.</p>

<p class='c001' ><i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Paternoster Kügelchen</span></i> were probably made from an
early date: the art may have been learned from wandering
Venetians. In Bohemia, <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Betel-Hütten</span></i> (‘bead furnaces’)
are mentioned early in the seventeenth century. At
Winterberg, of eight glass-furnaces four are so described.
Here we have the very word (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Betel</span></i>, from <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bete</span></i>, a prayer)
from which we have formed our term ‘bead.’ But
nothing quite equivalent to this last convenient word
ever came into use in Germany. From the word <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Paternoster-Kugel</span></i>,
when at a later time the demand came
rather for beads for personal ornament or for export, the
Germans passed to the ambiguous expression <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Perlen</span></i> or
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Glas-Perlen</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c001' >The manufacture of the more elaborate forms of beads
by means of the blow-pipe—the <i>suppialume</i> process of
the Venetians—spread slowly in the north. Doppelmayr
(<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 226) states that the use of ‘a little copper pipe
fixed over a burning lamp’ for making small objects of
glass was first taught at Nuremberg by one Abraham
Fino, who came from Amsterdam in 1630. The Dutch,
he says, had been taught the art by a Venetian. Kunckel,
on the Pfauen-Insel, was occupied in making beads for
exportation to West Africa by the newly founded Brandenburg
African Company. In the early years of the
eighteenth century the competition with Venice was
keen, but in this branch the Italians seem to have held
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_293' id='Page_293'>293</a></span>
their own. Not so, however, in the kindred industry,
the manufacture of glass pastes for artificial jewellery.
Before the middle of the century, certain districts in
Northern Bohemia obtained almost a monopoly in this
art. These ‘Bohemian stones’ were made first at
Turnau, by the Fischer brothers. This was early in the
century; by 1786 there were, it is said, 443 master-workmen
in the district thus employed. After that time
the first place was held by the rival town of Steinschönau,
to this day the centre of the industry (Lobmeyr, <cite>Die
Glas Industrie</cite>, 1874, p. 135).</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'     >In Holland the War of Independence does not seem
to have interfered with the work of the glass furnaces
already established in several of the towns
by Altarists or Venetians. M. Schuermans, who has
devoted a section of one of his letters to Holland (<i>op.
cit.</i>, vol. xxix. pp. 147-66), finds traces of the Italians
at Bois-le-Duc, Middelburg, Haarlem, and Amsterdam.
But by the beginning of the seventeenth century there
were already at Amsterdam glass-houses managed by
Dutchmen. M. Henri Havard has found in the registers
of the States-General mention of two Dutch glass-makers
who obtained at this time a privilege for fifteen
years to make ‘glasses for Rhine wine in the shape of
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemers</span></i> as well as beer glasses’ by certain new processes
(<cite>Oud Holland</cite>, i. 182). For a time there was an active
rivalry between the glass-makers of Amsterdam and
Antwerp: at a later period the enterprising Liége family
of the Bonhommes obtained a footing in several Dutch
towns. But, as I have already said, the ‘green glass’ of
the Rhine (not always necessarily green or even coloured)
was from early times in favour in Holland, if indeed we
are not to regard it as indigenous in the country. At a
later period there is no doubt that most of the finer
specimens were made there. It is glasses of this class,
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemers</span></i> in the first place, but also tall ‘flutes,’ that
we see so often in the works of the Dutch painters of the
seventeenth century. Those of a Venetian type, on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_295' id='Page_295'>295</a></span>
other hand, though by no means absent, are much rarer
than in the contemporary paintings of the Flemish
school.</p>

<p class='c001' >The Dutch seem above all to have esteemed the
<i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ruimer</span></i> or <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemer</span></i>; on glasses of this shape the finest
engraving and diamond-scratching were expended, and
it was these glasses that they selected to mount on tall
silver stands of elaborate workmanship. There are the
<i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bekerschroeven</span></i> (beaker-screws), which may at times be
seen on the buffet in a seventeenth-century Dutch interior.
There are several fine examples of these trophy-like
arrangements in the Rijks Museum at Amsterdam.</p>

<p class='c001' >For us, seeing that we must confine ourselves to
points of real artistic interest or historical significance,
the glass made by the Dutch in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries is of importance mainly under
these two aspects: 1. That here the art of engraving, or
rather scratching, with the diamond was carried to greater
perfection than in any other country. 2. That starting
from the close of the seventeenth century, the forms and
methods of construction of the Dutch drinking-glasses
(apart from the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemer</span></i>) first greatly influenced, and then
in turn were influenced by, our English glasses.</p>

<p class='c001' >As in Germany, where the Emperor Ferdinand <span class='fss'>III.</span>
learned the art, drawing with the diamond on glass was
in Holland practised as an elegant accomplishment by
people in good position, and above all by ladies. Indeed
we are here brought into contact with a cultured literary
set, a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coterie</span></i> of which the members held a higher social,
and perhaps intellectual, position than we can allow to
the majority of the great painters of the day whose
names are better known to us. Typical frequenters of
this circle were the three sisters, daughters of Roemer
Vischer, who were immortalised in the songs of
Huyghens, Cats, and Hooft (Don Henriques de Castro,
‘<cite>Een en ander over Glasgravure</cite>,’ <cite>Oud Holland</cite>, i. 286;
see also Hartshorne, p. 48). A still more famous literary
lady was Anna Maria van Schurman, who among so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_296' id='Page_296'>296</a></span>
many other accomplishments had, as Cats has recorded,
mastered the art ‘<i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">met een diamant op het glas gheestigh
to schrijven</span></i>.’<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c018'><sup>[224]</sup></a> Several good examples of the work of
these ladies, which took the form for the most part of
mottoes engraved with scrolls and flourishes on the
bowls of <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemers</span></i>, are preserved in the Rijks Museum:
some of these have been admirably reproduced by
Mr. Hartshorne in his work on English glasses.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c018'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Another interesting class of diamond-scratched Dutch
glass is well represented in the British Museum. Here
we find portraits of contemporary celebrities, of members
of the house of Orange in many cases, together with
coats-of-arms, scratched on the bowls of wine-glasses—either
conical glasses of Venetian forms or tall narrow
‘flutes.’ Sometimes, indeed, designs of this character are
found on winged glasses of purely Venetian type. Mr.
Nesbitt was of opinion that these were made in Venice
(Slade Catalogue, No. 891), but we now know, thanks to
M. Schuermans’ researches, that such glasses may well
have been produced at this time in the north. The
similarity in form of the bulbs or knops on the stems of
all the glasses of this series should be noted: in no case
is there any trace of cutting with the wheel on this part,
still less of any facetting. On a thin funnel-shaped glass
(Slade, No. 889) we have on one side the arms of England
and Orange-Nassau impaled, on the other is a
portrait of a lady in the costume of the middle of the
seventeenth century, doubtless the ‘counterfeit’ of Mary,
Princess of Orange, the daughter of Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span> It is to
her that we must refer the inscription in Gothic letters,
‘<i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het Welvaren Van De Princes</span></i>.’ In these Dutch
glasses scratched with the diamond may be found perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_297' id='Page_297'>297</a></span>
the earliest instances of glasses ‘that have been
made to speak.’</p>

<div class='figcontainer'>

</div></div>

<p class='c001' >Of quite another nature were the elaborate compositions
engraved for the most part with the wheel upon
plates of glass. It was to work of this kind that Gerard
Dou was brought up by his father—himself ‘a glass-worker
and writer on glass,’ and subsequently master of
the glass-makers’ guild at Leyden. The younger Dou
was apprenticed to one Dolendo, who is described as
‘a right good plate-etcher,’ before he entered the studio
of Rembrandt (Martin, <cite>Gerard Dou</cite>, pp. 28-29).</p>

<p class='c001' >There came into fashion in Holland in the next century
a method of engraving on glass, if engraving it can
be called, of quite a different nature. This is the stipple
or dotted method, the <em>stip</em> of the Dutch, by which a
design of the utmost delicacy—a mere breath, as it were—is
made to appear on the surface of the glass. When
examined with a glass the decoration is seen to be built
up of minute dots as in a stipple engraving,<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c018'><sup>[226]</sup></a> differing
from the latter, however, in this, that in the case of the
work on the glass, the lights are given by the dots and
the clear untouched ground represents the shadow.</p>

<p class='c001' >One of the earliest masters, if not the inventor of this
method, was Frans Greenwood, who appears indeed to
have worked with the wheel also. Greenwood—his name
would point to an English extraction—was born at
Rotterdam in 1680, and the latest date found on his
engraved work is 1743. There is in the British Museum
a wine-glass with a Bacchic subject, a highly finished
example of this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pointillé</span></i> process, signed ‘F. Greenwood
f<sup>t</sup>.’ In the eighteenth century this stippling on glass
was practised by painters of some note. Thus there are
two glasses in the Rijks Museum (dated 1750 and 1751)
both stippled with portrait heads, which bear the signature
of Aart Schouman, a portrait-painter of repute at
the time. But the greatest master of the art was Wolf,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_298' id='Page_298'>298</a></span>
an eccentric genius who lived at the Hague. We know
little of him except that he married in 1787, and died
young in 1808. Glasses stippled with graceful designs
by this master, somewhat in the manner of Bartolozzi,
are perhaps less rare than those of Greenwood or Schouman.
Some of his engravings are found upon goblets
of flint glass with facetted stems, of English make, probably.
On an example of his work in the British
Museum a graceful female figure bears a scroll with the
words, ‘<cite>Werken van het genootschap. K.W.D.A.V.</cite>’</p>

<p class='c001' >The tradition of Wolf was carried on by Daniel
Henriques de Castro, who died as late as 1862. The
son of the latter artist, in an article on the subject in
the first volume of <cite>Oud Holland</cite>, has collected some
traditions bearing on the methods of execution of this
now lost process. The author relates how he had come
across an old man who had watched Wolf while at work
on one of his glasses; according to his report, his only
tools were an etching-needle and a small hammer. This
is a matter of some importance, as both the late Mr.
Nesbitt and Mr. Hartshorne appear to have taken it for
granted that this delicate film-like engraving was produced,
in part at least, by means of acid. But the two
processes can hardly have been combined, and the effect
is quite unlike that produced when the surface of glass
is eaten away by hydrofluoric acid. It would, indeed, be
quite impossible to produce such delicate work by any
etching process of this latter kind.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c018'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >I shall have something to say of the Dutch wine-glasses
of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
when I come to speak of the English glasses that were
in a measure founded on them. Suffice to mention that
already, before the end of the seventeenth century, we
find on these glasses the welted foot and the baluster
stem moulded and uncut, enclosing one or more ‘tears’—forms
that somewhat later passed over to England.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'     >In an English work treating of glass, or rather of
certain descriptions of glass, and that chiefly from
the artistic point of view, what position in the book
and what relative amount of space should be given to the
glass of England?</p>

<p class='c001' >The position is, indeed, readily defined, for our
country has but slight claims to recognition as a producer
of artistic glass until the commencement of the eighteenth
century—indeed we may perhaps say until that century
was well advanced. The consideration, then, of the glass
of this country must be kept back until that of all the
other European States—Italy, France, Spain, Germany,
and the Netherlands—that have at one time or another
produced glass of artistic importance has been dealt with.</p>

<p class='c001' >As to the relative importance of our English glass
and the amount of space to be allotted to it, this is a
question difficult to answer. For a moment, no doubt,
towards the end of the eighteenth century, it held the
premier place in Europe, on the ground, above all, of
the excellence of the material. Advantage was taken of
certain exceptional qualities in the English flint or lead
glass to produce a deeply cut, facetted ware, solid and
brilliant, something undoubtedly <i>sui generis</i> and suitable
to its place on the sideboard, or on the well-polished
mahogany table when the cloth was removed. The
flashing fire of the lights cast back from the skilfully
arranged facets of the decanters and glasses, combined
with the softer reflections from the silver plate to give
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_300' id='Page_300'>300</a></span>
an undeniable charm and an individual stamp to these
late Georgian dinner-tables. This play of lights has
appealed to, and has been not unsuccessfully reproduced
by, more than one painter of the present day. But this
facetted ware, the one glory of our English glass, came
late into vogue, at a time when the prevailing fashions
allowed little room for any freedom of treatment, so that
it is only rarely that we can find any merit in the forms
and decorations of individual examples.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is, however, to a somewhat earlier period that the
modern enthusiast turns. His interest lies in the air-twisted
stems, the folded feet, and the bell-shaped bowls
of the drinking-glasses of the eighteenth century. Now
these, though made of flint glass, belong mostly to a
time before full advantage had been taken of the dispersive
power of that material upon the rays of light.
Here the question may well be asked—putting aside all
matter of historical or sentimental interest—what can we
say of these endless rows of glasses, classified and sub-classified
on the ground of variety of stem or bowl, as
<em>objects of art</em>? But this is a point upon which I should
prefer not to deliver a definite judgment; I have said
enough to indicate my personal standpoint. I can only
refer the reader to the copiously illustrated work of Mr.
Hartshorne on English glass, of which the larger part is
occupied with this branch of the subject.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c018'><sup>[228]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >It may be said that the history of English glass
divides itself into two periods. For the first we have
abundant documentary evidence—patents for new processes
and petitions for or against these patents, to say
nothing of notices in contemporary journals and
memoirs—but against this an almost total absence of
examples of the glass actually made. This period extends
from the early days of Elizabeth almost to the
end of the seventeenth century. In the second period,
on the other hand—and this includes nearly the whole
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_301' id='Page_301'>301</a></span>
of the eighteenth century—the documentary evidence
almost completely fails us; but in its place a fairly rich
material harvest is available—the wine-glass, above all,
so dear to the collector, now asserts itself.</p>

<p class='c001' >When at the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth, or
even a little earlier, a few rays of light begin to be thrown
upon the glass made in England, we find the industry
centred in a district on the borders of Surrey and
Sussex: we are here at the western extremity of the
great forest of the Weald, that was a little later to
become for a time the home of an important iron industry.
Here the raw materials and the fuel were at
hand. Fuel from the oaks and beeches, and from trees
of smaller growth; the silica from the ‘Hastings sands,’
selected from spots where the beds were tolerably free
from iron; and finally the alkali, for the most part from
the ashes of the bracken that then as now grew so
abundantly in the glades of the woods. For this old
English glass, like that of France, was essentially a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre
à fougère</span></i>,<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c018'><sup>[229]</sup></a> made in districts remote from towns. At a
somewhat later time the glass-workers were indeed forbidden
to set up their furnaces within twenty-two miles
of London, seven miles of Guildford, or within four miles
‘of the foot of the hills called the Sussex downs.’</p>

<p class='c001' >The little village of Chiddingfold, just within the
boundary of Surrey, may perhaps lay claim to be the
original ‘metropolis of English glass,’ and a line
measured from Hindhead to Petworth passes close to
the various places—Loxwood, Kirdford, Fernfold, Wisboro’
Green—where we know that furnaces were already
established early in the sixteenth century. I have already
referred to this district when speaking of the English
glass of mediæval times (see p. <a href='#Page_139'>139</a>). Fragments of
green glass have been found on the site of a glass-house
at Chiddingfold. In the Museum at Lewes are two
bulbous flasks with long necks of this green Weald-glass.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_302' id='Page_302'>302</a></span>
There was another centre of the glass industry in East
Sussex, in the country to the north of Hastings. In a
mediæval document concerning Beckley, in this district,
the name Glassye Borough occurs. At these woodland
glass-houses, for many generations, the wandering
pedlars, the ‘glass-men,’ had been wont to renew the
stock of ‘vrynells, bottles, bowles, cuppis to drinck and
such lyke,’ that they hawked along the country-side. You
may send, says Thomas Charnock in his <cite>Breviary of
Philosophy</cite> (1557), to Chiddingfold, to the ‘glassemaker,’</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And desire him in most humble wise</div>
      <div class='line'>To blow thee a glass after thy devise.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001' >That is to say, that the glass-blower, as we have seen in
other cases, worked from the patterns provided by his
customers.</p>

<p class='c001' >Camden says of the Sussex glass that in his time it
was only used ‘of the common sort.’ Possibly the
Sussex glass-blowers made quarrels and bull’s-eyes for
windows also;<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c018'><sup>[230]</sup></a> this, however, was an industry that
centred rather in London, especially in Southwark.
Now it was above all the demand for larger and better
made panes for use in the new mansions with spacious
windows—the ‘glass houses’ of the proverb about throwing
stones—that were now springing up on every side,
that gave the most powerful impulse to the introduction
of the newer methods of working glass that had already
taken root in France and in the Low Countries. It must
be remembered that in the preparation of the stained
glass for church windows large pieces were not required.
Considerable artistic skill in this branch would be quite
compatible with a very primitive method of blowing and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_303' id='Page_303'>303</a></span>
‘flashing’ the glass. At this time the new industry—the
making of large sheets of broad-glass, that is to say—was
centred in Lorraine, in the country stretching
from the Vosges to the Ardennes; in a lesser degree in
Normandy. It is uncertain in what the superiority of
the ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre en tables quarrées</span></i>’ made by the Lorrainers
consisted; there is no positive proof that they had as yet
adopted the German cylinder process (see pp. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a> and
<a href='#f174'>234 <i>note</i></a>), though this is in every way probable.</p>

<p class='c001' >The French glass-workers who came to England
belonged, for the most part, to the old noble families.
We find in our English documents some of the very
names—Hennezel, for instance—that occur in the famous
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charte des verriers</span></i> granted by John of Calabria, son of
King René, in the year 1448 (see p. <a href='#Page_230'>230</a>).<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c018'><sup>[231]</sup></a> When these
foreigners are mentioned in our English documents they
are invariably described as gentlemen or esquires.</p>

<p class='c001' >We must remember that in the sixteenth century
Antwerp held a commercial position something like that
taken later by Amsterdam and London: the town was,
above all, the centre of the glass trade. It is not surprising
then to find that it was through the medium
of an Antwerp merchant, one Jean Carré, that the French
glass-makers were now introduced into England.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c018'><sup>[232]</sup></a> Carré,
in association with a certain Briot, brought over both
Normans and Lorrainers, and the quarrels and disputes
that soon broke out appear to have had their origin in
the fact that the men to whom the first patents were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_304' id='Page_304'>304</a></span>
granted were not practical workers themselves, and that
they were therefore dependent on others.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c018'><sup>[233]</sup></a> In any case,
before the year 1570, gentlemen of Lorraine bearing the
well-known names of Hennezel, Du Thisac, and Le
Houx, as well, probably, as representatives of the Le
Vaillant and other Norman families, were making glass
in more than one spot in the Weald as well as in London.</p>

<p class='c001' >But these proud, hot-headed foreigners do not seem
to have been popular in Sussex. There were frequent
petitions against the destruction of the woods to supply
the fuel for their glass-houses, and we hear of an attempt
made to rob the ‘outlandish men’ that made glass near
Petworth and to burn their houses. Before 1576, then,
the Lorrainers were already in search of forests where
they could work without hindrance; they began that long
peregrination that took them by way of the Hampshire
woods to the Forest of Dean, and finally to Stourbridge
and Newcastle.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c018'><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >Some remains of a glass-house at Buckholt Wood, on
the line of the old Roman road between Salisbury and
Winchester, had long attracted the attention of antiquaries
before a satisfactory explanation of their origin could be
found. Large quantities of broken window-glass, as well
as fragments of glass of many other kinds, including
some of distinctly Venetian type, had at times been dug
up. These remains, doubtless, represent a store of
‘cullet’ or old broken glass destined to be remelted, and
therefore not necessarily all of it made on the spot.
Fragments, too, of the glass-pots were found, of a greyish-white
clay not of local origin. It is only quite recently
that with these discoveries have been associated certain
entries in the registries of the Walloon Church at Southampton
(these were published a few years ago by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_305' id='Page_305'>305</a></span>
Huguenot Society). Among those admitted to the Lord’s
Supper, in the years 1576 to 1579, we find the names of
members of the Du Thisac, Hennezel, and Le Houx
families, all Lorrainers, as well as that of Pierre Vaillant,
a Norman. These communicants are described in the
registry as ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ouvriers de verre a la verriere de boute haut</span></i>’
(elsewhere spelt <i>Bocquehaut</i>), a fairly good French rendering
of the word Buckholt. It is not every day that one
comes across so neat and conclusive an instance of
documentary research supplementing and completing the
work of the ‘men of the spade.’</p>

<p class='c001' >But here again, in spite of the attraction of the not far
distant Walloon Church, the Lorrainers made but a short
stay. In 1599 one ‘Abraham Tysack, son of a frenchman
at the glasse-house,’ was baptized at Newent, in the
Forest of Dean, where, at any rate, there can have been
no deficiency of fuel. But the wanderers made apparently
no long stay in the district, for we find that some at least
of the number after a few years settled at Stourbridge,
in Worcestershire. The famous clay of this district, still
unsurpassed as a material for the glass-pots, was, it would
seem, already worked along with the beds of coal which
this clay underlies. Here, at King’s Swinford, in 1612,
the name of Tyzack occurs in local records, and a little
later, at Old Swinford, those of Henzey and Tittery. In
this neighbourhood some members of these families at
length settled down, maintaining close relations with certain
of their relatives who pushed on as far as Newcastle-on-Tyne.
At this last town, in 1617, a Henzey was fain
to enter the service of Sir Robert Mansell, who was already
bringing the principal glass-workers of England within
the net of his monopoly.</p>

<p class='c001' >I have dwelt on the wanderings of these Lorrainers,
who were above all makers of window-glass, as to them
rather than to the Venetians is due, I think, the definite
establishment of a glass industry in England. For it
must be borne in mind that the principal stimulus
came from the demand for better and larger panes
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_306' id='Page_306'>306</a></span>
for the windows of the new renaissance houses,—somewhat
later, perhaps, for the windows of ‘glass-coaches’
also.</p>

<p class='c019' >Already early in the sixteenth century not a few
examples of Venetian and, perhaps, even of Oriental
glass, may have found their way into the houses of the
wealthy. But we must regard as quite exceptional—the
result, probably, of some passing whim of the king—the
collection of 371 pieces of glass that were in 1542
in the possession of Henry <span class='fss'>VIII.</span> These are described
under the head of ‘Glasses and sundry other things of
erthe’ in an inventory of certain valuable effects in the
Palace at Westminster (<cite>Archæological Journal</cite>, vol.
xviii., 1861). Among them there is mention of flagons,
basins, ewers, standing-cups, cruses, layers, spice-plates,
and even forks and spoons of glass. Many of these
pieces are described as ‘jasper-colour’—these were probably
of a kind of <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">schmelz</span></i>—and there is frequent reference
in the list to ‘blue glass’ and ‘glass of many
colours.’ A ‘layer’ with the initials ‘H and A engraven
on the cover,’ as well as a cup with ‘Quene Annes sipher
engraven on it,’ had doubtless belonged to Anne Boleyn.
The following items are of some interest:—</p>

<p class='c001' >‘One thicke glasse of christall with a case of lether
lined with crymson vellat.’</p>

<p class='c001' >‘Three aulter Candlestickes of glasse.’</p>

<p class='c001' >‘Oone Holly-water stocke of glasse with a bayle.’</p>

<p class='c001' >‘Twelve bottles of glasse with oone cover to them
all wrought with diaper work white.’ By this last
expression are we to understand some kind of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetro
di trina</span></i>?</p>

<p class='c001' >Finally, ‘One rounde Loking Glass sett in a frame of
wood, vj cornered, painted under glass with the armes of
Ingland, Spayne, and Castile’ carries us back to the days
when Catherine of Aragon was queen. Of this method
of decorating the frames of mirrors with inlay of glass
painted on the inner surface I have already spoken.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_307' id='Page_307'>307</a></span>
I would again refer the reader to the mirror in the
Arnolfini Van Eyck at the National Gallery.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c018'><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019' >The earliest notice that we have of Venetian glass-workers
in England carries us back to the year 1550,
and it takes a form that is characteristic of the times.
This is a petition to the Council of Ten, that has been
found among the Venetian state papers. It is signed by
no less than eight Muranese glass-workers, imprisoned
in the Tower of London: they declare that they are
threatened with the gibbet if they fail to work out their
contract. These poor men were indeed between the
devil and the deep sea; for did they delay their return
to their homes they were liable, by a newly issued edict,
to a long term in the Venetian galleys. It was only by
the personal intervention of the young king that some
arrangement was finally made that allowed of these
Muranese glass-workers returning unmolested after working
off part of their contract. One of these men indeed
elected to remain behind, but he before long made his
way to the Low Countries, and this first influx of
Venetian workmen seems to have led to little as far as
English glass was concerned.</p>

<p class='c001' >Cornelius de Lannoy, from whom Cecil hoped so
much, was perhaps as much an alchemist and a universal
schemer as a worker in glass. He was set to work at
Somerset House in 1564, but with little result, it would
seem. He attributed his failure to the clumsiness of the
English workmen and to the want of a suitable clay for
his glass-pots.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is to Jacopo Verzelini, a man evidently of some
energy and resource, that we must give the credit of first
successfully making the Venetian <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> in England.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_308' id='Page_308'>308</a></span>
When in 1575 he obtained a patent ‘for the makinge of
all manner of counterfayt Venyse drinkinge glasses’ (but
not, it would appear, of glass for windows), he was
already established in London. Stow, writing a little
later, says: ‘The first making of Venise glasses in
England began at the Crotchet Friars, about the beginning
of the reign of Q. Elizabeth, by one Jacob Vessaline
an Italian.’ The Friars Hall, he tells us, ‘was made a
glasse-house, wherein was made glasse of divers sorts to
drincken.’ It was in this same hall probably that the
unhappy craftsmen of Edward <span class='fss'>VI.</span>’s time had been set to
work. Verzelini, like other glass-workers of the period,
reached England, it appears, by way of Antwerp. At
any rate he was married to a lady of that town, of good
family, who bore him twelve children. This we know
from the monumental brass to his memory that may
still be seen in the little church of Down in Kent, where
in the year 1606 he was buried.</p>

<p class='c001' >We see, then, that before the death of Elizabeth the
making of both hollow ware and window-glass by the
new methods was firmly established in London and
in the provinces. Great complaints had already arisen
of ‘the making of glass by strangers and outlandish
men,’ and we hear of ‘the timber and woods spoiled by
the glass-houses.’<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c018'><sup>[236]</sup></a> The same difficulty arose as in
France. It was argued that the foreigner should be
required to take native apprentices. But there is evidence
that as late as the first quarter of the seventeenth century,
the making of the better kinds of glass, the ‘Christalline
Morana Glass,’ was still in the hands of Italians. This
we have seen was for long the case in France as well.
But we in England were in a measure dependent upon
the foreigner for our window-glass also, this time upon
the Lorrainer.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of glass made in England during Elizabeth’s reign
I can point to a goblet now in the British Museum.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_309' id='Page_309'>309</a></span>
It is dated 1586, and bears an inscription in capitals of
somewhat Gothic character—<span class='fss'>IN : GOD : IS : AL : MI : TRUST</span>.
The glass is engraved with the diamond, and is decorated
with stringings of white enamel.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c018'><sup>[237]</sup></a> The plain cylindrical
glass tankard in the Gold Room is remarkable only for
the silver-gilt mounting and for the arms of Cecil on
the cover.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c018'><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >We have seen that early in the seventeenth century
the French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gentilshommes de verre</span></i> were firmly established
at Stourbridge and at Newcastle. Now by this
time the outcry against the destruction of our English
forests, the source of the timber for the navy, was
becoming general. It was directed against the iron-smelters
in the first place, and then against the makers
of glass, above all against foreigners. ‘It were the less
evil,’ says a proclamation of 1615, ‘to reduce the times
into the ancient manner of drinking in stone and of
lattice windows than to suffer the loss of such a treasure.’
It was in the Stourbridge district that Bub Dudley<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c018'><sup>[239]</sup></a> and
others were occupied at this very time with the problem
of smelting iron by means of pit-coal. With them was
probably associated Thomas Percivall, to whom more
than to any one else is to be given the credit of the first
successful employment of coal in the glass-furnace.</p>

<p class='c001' >Others were working on the same lines. To Sir
William Slingsby and his associates a licence was issued
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_310' id='Page_310'>310</a></span>
in 1610, but this was a very general document, vaguely
worded. More precise was the patent granted the next
year to Sir Edward Zouche, Thomas Percivall, and
others. It was under this patent that the process was
perfected, probably at the glass-house at Lambeth, under
the charge of Percivall. Only a few years later, in 1616,
English coal was brought into use at the glass-works
of St. Sever, near Rouen, very likely through the
mediation of one of the Norman glass-workers settled
in England.</p>

<p class='c001' >There were many difficulties to be overcome before
this pit-coal could be used with success. Greater care had
to be taken in the selection of the materials for the pots—perhaps
without the Stourbridge clay success would
not have been attained—and it was found to be necessary
to ‘close the pots,’ that is to say, to use a covered crucible
so as to protect the glass from the smoky, sulphurous
gases given off by the coal. The credit of the invention
of these closed pots, with the mouth at the side facing the
opening of the furnace, is also to be given to Percivall.</p>

<p class='c001' >I dwell on these practical details for a special reason.
In the first place, the use of coal and the consequent
change in the form of the crucibles mark the beginning
of English glass as a distinct <i>genre</i>. Again, this change
is closely connected with a further and still more important
step—the use of lead as an essential constituent
in a new kind of ‘metal,’ the famous English flint-glass
of later days. It is these two novelties that form our
contribution to the technique of glass-making. Not that
I can find any proof that lead-glass was made in
England at so early a date. But on the one hand the
use of a covered pot rendered it more difficult, at that
time at least, thoroughly to melt the contents, and therefore
favoured the use of a more fusible mixture; on the
other, in the case of a glass containing lead, it is above
all essential to protect the ‘metal’ from the fire.</p>

<p class='c001' >The history of the progress of glass-making in
England from the early days of Elizabeth to the outbreak
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_311' id='Page_311'>311</a></span>
of the Civil War in the next century, is chiefly concerned
with the licences and patents granted to a succession of
English and foreign ‘adventurers.’<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c018'><sup>[240]</sup></a> No doubt there
were many abuses in this system; but it is impossible
to overlook the fact that the Cecils and the other advisers
of the Queen were enabled by such means to encourage
the foundation of many industries, and this chiefly by the
help of foreigners. For at the beginning of Elizabeth’s
reign we had fallen sadly behind in the matter of the
industrial arts. Not only France and Italy, but Germany
too and the Netherlands, had much to teach us.</p>

<p class='c001' >Already, however, before the death of the Queen and
still more in the next reign, there arose, as I have said,
a great popular outcry against the monopolists, and this
feeling of indignation found an echo in more than one
of James’s parliaments. It is the more strange, therefore,
to find that it was during this reign that the whole
glass industry of the country fell for the first and last
time into the hands of one man. But this was no other
than Sir Robert Mansell, Admiral of the Fleet, a man of
exceptional energy and a born fighter, one who had in
early life had more than one brush with the Spaniards.
King James, when approached on the subject of Mansell’s
glass monopoly, marvelled that ‘Robin Mansell being a
seaman, whereby he hath got so much honour, should
fall from water to tamper with fire.’</p>

<p class='c001' >The first we hear of Mansell in this connection
is in the year 1615, when we find him associated with
Sir Edward Zouche, Thelwell, Percivall, and others in
a patent for making glass with sea-coal. But before this
he had probably for some time been interested in certain
London glass-works. And now before two years had
elapsed he had bought out all his partners<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c018'><sup>[241]</sup></a> and commenced
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_312' id='Page_312'>312</a></span>
his reign as ‘glass-king.’ This monopoly, in
spite of frequently renewed opposition, Mansell succeeded
in maintaining up to the time of his death in the days
of the Protectorate. He hunted down the local glass-houses
where wood, now forbidden by law, was still
employed. He granted licences to some of the Lorrainers
working at Stourbridge and elsewhere, while—as at
Newcastle, where he had glass-works under his direct
management—he took others of these foreigners into his
employ. In London, on the other hand, at the glass-furnaces
of Winchester House, which he now took over,
Sir Robert employed Italians.</p>

<p class='c001' >We here come into contact with another and not less
interesting man, James Howell, like his master Mansell,
a Welshman.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c018'><sup>[242]</sup></a> Howell was in 1618 ‘steward of the
glasse-house’ in Southwark, but he was glad to change
this position for that of traveller for Mansell in Spain
and Italy; for, so he writes to his father, ‘I should in
a short time have melted away to nothing among these
hot Venetians.’ His duties were now to obtain workmen
from Italy, and the raw materials, especially the
‘barillia,’ from Spain. In the following year he brought
over one of the famous Miotti family from Middelburg,
and not long afterwards we find him writing from Alicante
an interesting account of the ‘Barillia, a strange kind of
vegetable that grows nowhere upon the surface of the
Earth, in that perfection as here.’ ‘The Venetians have
it hence,’ he continues, and he proceeds to give a detailed
account of the method of preparation (Book <span class='fss'>I.</span>
section <span class='fss'>I.</span> xxv.). Howell’s letters from Venice are most
interesting, and have provided many ‘elegant extracts’
for later writers. For instance, there is a passage in
which he speaks of ‘lasses and glasses,’ and of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_313' id='Page_313'>313</a></span>
brittleness that beauty shares with the mirrors of Venice<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c018'><sup>[243]</sup></a>—the
rest of the passage is, however, rather too outspoken
for our present taste.</p>

<p class='c001' >The contention between Mansell and the anti-monopolists
was above all warm about the year 1623, on the
occasion of the renewal of his patent for another
fifteen years, and the ‘New Patent,’ the ‘Reasons against
the same,’ Mansell’s ‘Defence’ and his ‘Motives and
Reasons,’ and finally the ‘Answer’ to this last, followed
in quick succession. All these documents and pamphlets
are reproduced by Mr. Hartshorne; they form indeed
an important source of information for the history of
English glass. From them we learn that Mansell, after
many failures elsewhere and the expenditure of many
thousand pounds, first at Newcastle successfully made
window-glass with the native coal; that the clay for the
pots was at the commencement brought from Staffordshire,
but that as the English clay proved unsatisfactory,
he obtained a better material at infinite cost ‘from beyond
Roan in France,’ and finally from ‘Spawe in Germany.’
At the time he was writing he indeed protests that he
had already sunk £24,000 in his ventures.</p>

<p class='c001' >The precise position of Mansell after the expiration in
1638 of the second term of his patent is somewhat
obscure, but he seems to have steered well among the
troubles of the time and to have maintained his monopoly.
At the period in question, he tells us he was producing
‘Ordinary Drinking Glasses’ for wine and for beer at
four shillings and half a crown a dozen respectively, as
well as mortar-glasses<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c018'><sup>[244]</sup></a> at one-and-fourpence a dozen.
He was at the same time making beer and wine glasses
of crystal (these were from two to three times as dear as
the last), beside looking-glasses and spectacle-glass plates
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_314' id='Page_314'>314</a></span>
in rivalry with the Venetians; finally, with English
materials, window-glass and ‘green-glasses.’</p>

<p class='c001' >There is nothing in all this, or indeed in any of these
patents and petitions, to point to the existence of lead-glass
at this time. The use of barilla, I may add, is incompatible
with the preparation of a lead-glass; in such
a glass it is essential that the alkali should be potash.
On the whole, during the long period of the Mansell
monopoly (from 1615 to, say, 1655) little progress appears
to have been made in the manufacture of glass, but of
course we must make allowance for the times of civil
strife that filled the latter part of this period.</p>

<p class='c001' >After the Restoration the issue of patents began
again. Everything points at this time to a renewal of
interest in Venetian glass. When, however, in 1663 the
Duke of Buckingham obtained his licence, his claim was
based upon the improvements he had made in the looking-glass
plates and in the plates for the glass-coaches.
As in France, sheets of large size and good material were
now in demand for both purposes. It was somewhat later,
it would seem, that he turned his attention to making
hollow ware in the Venetian fashion. Although nitre, a
salt of potash,<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c018'><sup>[245]</sup></a> played an important part in the glass made
by the duke, there is no proof that any use was made of
red lead or of litharge. Evelyn, who in 1673 visited the
duke’s ‘Italian glass-house at Greenwich where glasse
was blown of finer metal than that of Murano at Venice,’
says nothing about such substances being employed.</p>

<p class='c001' >But in spite of this progress in the home industry,
the importation of chests of glass from Venice was at its
height in the reign of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> This we see from the
correspondence of a London glass merchant, one John
Greene (1667-1672), with a Venetian firm, which has
fortunately been preserved.<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c018'><sup>[246]</sup></a> Along with these letters
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_315' id='Page_315'>315</a></span>
were found the ‘office copies’ of the patterns which
Greene sent out to Venice as a guide to the glass-blowers.
Here we have mention of ‘clouded calsedonia glasses’
for beer, claret, and sack, ‘creuits with or without feet,
brandj tumblers,’ and ‘glasse floure potts.’ Not the least
interesting item is the ‘Rhenish wine glasse,’ which is
illustrated by a typical roemer with prunts on the stem,
almost our only evidence of the use of these goblets in
England. Greene advises his Venetian correspondent
that the looking-glasses and the coach-glasses are to be
packed at the bottom of the cases to escape if possible
the search of the custom-house officials. What especially
strikes one in examining the patterns of the drinking-glasses,
which form the bulk of the orders (Hartshorne,
Plates 30-32), is the fact that the stem or shank, so
important a part of the eighteenth-century glass, is not
yet developed; the conical bowl is separated from the
foot by a simple or fluted bulb, or sometimes by two
such bulbs or knops.</p>

<p class='c001' >But this Venetian trade had now seen its best days;
there are some hints of a falling off in Greene’s last two
letters (1671-1672). On the other hand, during all this
period the enterprising glass firms of the Netherlands
kept up a close intercourse with England. As early as
1662 a patent for making various kinds of glass was
obtained by one John Colenet, whom Mr. Hartshorne
has very plausibly claimed as a member of the great
glass-making family of Ghent and Namur, the De Colnets,
so often mentioned in the letters of M. Schuermans.
A few years later the tables were turned, for now the
De Colnet firm was fain to engage an Englishman to
produce ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verre à l’Angleterre</span></i>.’ In 1680 the great rival
firm of Liége, the De Bonhommes, according to a document
quoted by M. Schuermans (Letter vii.), was already
making ‘<i>flint-glass à l’Anglaise</i>.’</p>

<p class='c001' >Now this statement brings me face to face with
what is the great crux in the history of English
glass—the question, namely, when and where lead-glass
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_316' id='Page_316'>316</a></span>
was first applied to the manufacture of hollow
ware.</p>

<p class='c001' >But first I must say a word of a little book published
in 1662. This is the already-mentioned translation by
Christopher Merret of the <i>Arte Vetraria</i> of Antonio Neri
(see p. 7). Merret, who was a man well abreast of the
science of his day and an early, if not an original, member
of the newly founded Royal Society, has supplemented
Neri’s series of recipes with certain ‘Observations’ of his
own. Here may be found some curious information
concerning the materials used in the manufacture of the
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>, for it is with this glass that the author is chiefly
concerned. Merret does not appear to have had much
acquaintance with the glass made in England in his day.
For the practical details of the furnace and for the processes
of glass-blowing he takes us back to Agricola.
Both Neri and his translator are indeed for the most part
occupied with the nature and preparation of the materials,
and with the various methods by which glass may be
coloured.<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c018'><sup>[247]</sup></a> Neri, like all the old writers, knew of the
merits of lead-glass in the preparation of pastes for
the manufacture of artificial gems; in his sixty-first
section he tells us: ‘Glass of lead, known to few in this
art, as to colour is the finest and noblest glass at this
day made in the furnace. For in this glass the colours
imitate the Oriental gems, which cannot be done in
crystal. But unless diligence be used all sorts of pots
will be broken, and the metal will run into the furnace.’
Upon this passage Merret observes: ‘Glass of Lead!
’Tis a thing unpractised in our furnaces, and the reason
is because of the exceeding brittleness thereof.’ Lead,
he continues, is indeed the principal ingredient in the
glaze of the potter, ‘and could this glass be made as
tough as Crystalline, ’twould far surpass it in the glory
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_317' id='Page_317'>317</a></span>
and beauty of its colours.’ Thus we see, with Merret as
with Neri, the great merit of lead-glass is the capacity
possessed by it of bringing out the colours of metallic
oxides. They still regard the material from the mediæval
point of view. The bad working qualities of this glass
of which Merret complains may very probably have been
due to the fact that, starting from the basis of their
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>, the glass-workers continued to use the soda-holding
barilla instead of employing a potash salt.</p>

<p class='c001' >The Venetians in the preparation of their <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>
laid great stress on the hard white pebbles, the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cogoli</span></i>,
from the bed of the Po or of the Ticino; these they regarded
as an essential constituent of a good glass. We
in England, during the reign of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>, succeeded in
replacing these pebbles by our native flints; and this
English flint-glass,<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c018'><sup>[248]</sup></a> properly so-called, early acquired a
good reputation on the Continent. The ingenious Mr.
John Houghton, writing in 1683 (<cite>Letters for the Improvement
of Husbandry and Trade</cite>), after speaking of
our dependence upon the Venetians some years since,
goes on to say: ‘Now by the fashion of using glasses in
coaches and other good means we easily enough serve
our neighbours.’ In 1682 he tells us there were exported
from England two thousand five hundred and seventy-two
drinking-glasses, besides some looking-glasses and
‘window chests.’ This confirms what I have said of the
date when English flint-glass became well known in the
Low Countries. Now it is generally taken for granted
that by this time the term flint-glass had come to mean
lead-glass. Certainly soon after the beginning of the
next century lead-glass was already recognised as essentially
a substance of English origin; but, as I have said,
there is unfortunately not a word of evidence, documentary
or otherwise, to show when or where this glass was
first made, nor is it possible, I think, to point to any
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_318' id='Page_318'>318</a></span>
example of this lead-glass to which an earlier date than
the first or second decade of the eighteenth century can
be attributed. Indeed everything points to the English
flint-glass of the last quarter of the seventeenth century
being a form of the Venetian <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c001' >In any case it is essential to bear in mind that both
in chemical composition and in physical properties no
two things could be more unlike than the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> on
which the early flint-glass, properly so called, was
founded, and the lead-glass which afterwards usurped
the name.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c018'><sup>[249]</sup></a> The one is a typical soda-lime, the other an
equally definite potash-lead glass, and the materials had
to be sought for from entirely different sources.</p>

<p class='c001' >The above-mentioned Mr. John Houghton, who
every week, in the commercial paper edited by him,
published an article on some technical or scientific
subject, in the spring of 1696 devoted a series of these
‘leaders’ to the subject of glass. After some general
reflections on the substance, when we are told, among
other things, that ‘Vitrification is the last mutation of
bodies of which Nature is capable and from which there
is no going back,’ in his issue of May 2 he takes up the
main subject. ‘According to my information,’ he tells
us, ‘we are of late greatly improved in the art of
<em>Glass-making</em>. For I remember the time when the Duke
of <em>Buckingham</em> first encouraged <em>glass-plates</em>, and <em>Mr.
Ravenscroft</em> first made <em>Flint-glass</em>.<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c018'><sup>[250]</sup></a> Since then we have
mended our Window-glass and outdo all abroad. And
what e’er may be said against <em>Stock-Jobbery</em>, yet it has
been the Means to raise great Summs of Money to
improve this Art.’ Again, on May 16 we are given a
carefully classified list of ninety glass-houses existing in
England. Of these, twenty-four were in London, nine
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_319' id='Page_319'>319</a></span>
at Bristol, seventeen at Stourbridge, and eleven at
Newcastle. These glass-houses he divides into those for
looking-glass plates, for bottles and for ‘<em>Flint, Green,
and Ordinary</em>.’ Now the rational inference from all
this seems to me to be that Houghton, <em>who was in a
position to know</em>, knew nothing about lead-glass. The
flint-glass houses are classed together with the ‘green’
and ‘ordinary,’ and flint-glass for him was glass made
from flints.</p>

<p class='c001' >So, as we have seen, Haudicquer de Blancourt, writing
in France a few years earlier, knew nothing of lead-glass
other than that used for objects of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verroterie</span></i>.
It is at least evident that if our own glass-makers had
mastered the art before the end of the century, the
secret was well kept.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c018'><sup>[251]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >But before proceeding further, it may be well to form
some definite idea of the composition of lead-glass and of
the physical properties that led to its replacing in great
measure the soda-lime glass of Venetian type. In the
first place, as I have said, it is essential that the alkali in
this glass (in the manufacture of hollow ware, at least)
should be potash, and it was, perhaps, the fact that the
lead was at first used along with soda that so long
delayed the production of a ‘metal’ suitable for the
manufacture of blown-glass. Again, the potash in the
case of lead-glass must be something quite different
from the impure material employed for the old green
glass; this crude alkali contained, among other bases,
a large percentage of lime. Saltpetre appears to have
been used in the first place, and then a more carefully
lixiviated form of vegetable ashes known as pearl-ash.
The amount of lead oxide may vary from 28 to 40 per
cent., and the specific gravity of the resultant glass
from 2·8 to 3·6.</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_320' id='Page_320'>320</a></span>
The great merit of lead-glass lies in its absolute
transparency and brilliancy, combined with a certain
darkness in the shadows. This brilliancy and fire, it is
well to point out, are only indirectly dependent upon the
refractive power exercised by the glass upon the rays
of light that pass through it; in this respect lead-glass
differs little from rock crystal or from the Venetian
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i>. But one quality it has which distinguishes
it from all other kinds of glass as well as from nearly
all transparent natural stones, the diamond, of course,
excepted. This is the power possessed by it of <em>dispersing</em>
the rays of white light: the elements of which this light
is composed in passing through lead-glass are bent
aside in <em>different degrees</em>, so that the issuing ray is
broken up into its component colours. This it is that
gives fire, but this fire is only fully brought out by means
of facetted or angular surfaces. On this point—the
distinction between refraction and dispersion—a good
deal of confusion exists. The following table, which I
borrow from a little book on gems by Professor Church,
may help to clear up this point:—</p>

<table class='c015' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c009'></td>
    <td class='c021'>Refractive Index.</td>

</table>

<p class='c001' >We here see that lead-glass or flint-glass has little
greater refractive power on light than rock crystal or the
ordinary plate and crown glass of commerce which belongs
to the same family as the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> of the Venetians. In
dispersive power, on the other hand, it stands apart from
both these substances and rivals the diamond in scattering

  <h2 id='ch20' class='c005'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />ENGLISH GLASS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_8 c006'     >We may probably regard the reign of William <span class='fss'>III.</span>
as the turning-point in the history of our
English glass as in so many other of our
minor arts. It is to that period that one must assign the
first beginnings of our modern industrial life,<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c018'><sup>[252]</sup></a> and it is
in the Dutch influence, at that time so dominant, that the
principal stimulus is to be found.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of the window and mirror glass of the period a most
interesting series is preserved at Hampton Court. Many
of the panes of the windows facing the garden façades of
the palace are strongly tinged with purple, a result of
the process by which the colourless protoxide of manganese
is reconverted into the purple bin-oxide under the
influence of sunlight. Placed between the windows in
William <span class='fss'>III.</span>’s state bedroom are some curious mirrors
with frames ornamented with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appliqué</span></i> plates of deep blue
glass carved into patterns and monograms. Observe,
too, a charming mirror of the same period over the fireplace
in this room.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is, however, still difficult to point to surviving
examples to illustrate the vessels of English glass made
about this period. Certain covered bowls (such as that
reproduced by Mr. Hartshorne on p. 238 of his great
work) may date back to the end of the seventeenth
century. The same author gives an illustration of a fine
posset-pot with quilled handles, preserved at Chastleton.
This bowl, decorated with roses, masks, and berry-like
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_322' id='Page_322'>322</a></span>
prunts, may be as old as Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>’s reign. When one
calls to mind the picturesque pottery—the slip-ware—that
was made at the time, it would seem not unlikely
that in the local glass-houses something similar may
have been attempted in glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >We have, of course, plenty of glass wine-bottles, a
few of which may date as far back as the reign of
Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span> These bottles are mostly of a black impure
glass and of a globular form, squat and compressed at
the sides, reminding one of the leather <i>botel</i> from which
our word bottle is derived. Similar bottles are found
in the Low Countries, and they may often be seen in Dutch
pictures. The introduction of the practice of bottling
wine, as far as England is concerned, is generally connected
with Sir Kenelm Digby, that universal genius who,
in the reign of Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span>, was occupied with so many
branches of the arts. Drinking-bottles of this description,
dating from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
are often dug up while excavating the foundations
of houses. An extensive collection, chiefly of local origin,
may be seen in the Guildhall Museum, and Mr. Hilton
Price has a representative series derived also from excavations
in the city. The surface of these bottles is
often covered with an iridescent scale giving them an
appearance of great age. A circular stamp bearing the
maker’s name is sometimes found on the shoulder, but
these stamped bottles are in all cases, I think, of later
date. There is a small collection of these stamps in the
British Museum.</p>

<p class='c001' >I have already pointed out that during the reign of
Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> the prevalent form of the drinking-glass was
still of the old Venetian type. The stem was almost
non-existent; it was at best represented by a spherical
bulb connecting the two cones—the upper one often
truncated, the lower very shallow—that formed respectively
the bowl and the foot. In the Spanish Netherlands,
before the end of the century, another form became
prevalent: the stem now assumes more or less a baluster
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_323' id='Page_323'>323</a></span>
form, divided from the bowl by a distinct shoulder; the
knop of this stem is often hollow, and generally duplicated.
In some cases a silver coin is found lying loose
in this hollow bulb. Such a form we may perhaps
regard as the starting-point for the vast and varied
series of English drinking-glasses which constitutes the
principal element in a collection of English glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >Since the drinking-glass forms so important a part in
the history of our native glass, perhaps it may be well to
turn for a moment to consider the process by which a
vessel of this sort is made, the more so as we are told by
a high practical authority that in the manufacture of a
wine-glass every principle of glass-blowing is illustrated
(H. J. Powell, <cite>Principles of Glass-making</cite>, 1883). Wine-glasses,
says Mr. Powell, may have either a ‘straw shank
or stem’ pulled out from the substance of the bowl itself,
or more often a ‘stuck shank’ made from a separate
piece of glass subsequently added to the bowl; again, the
foot may be either blown or cast.</p>

<p class='c001' >I will take as an example a wine-glass with a ‘straw
shank’ and a blown foot. ‘The glass for the bowl is
first gathered and blown to the required shape. Upon
the centre of the base of the bowl, which is still attached
to the blow-pipe, a small quantity of molten glass is
skilfully dropped from the end of a working rod [the
pontil]. Part of the added glass is formed into a small
button by the grip of the spring tool [procello], and the
residue is pulled out into the stem. In the meantime a
smaller bulb has been blown and its extremity fixed to
the end of the stem from which the button has previously
been removed. The smaller bulb is severed in the midst
and the cup-shaped remnant adhering to the stem is
reheated, opened by the insertion of one point of the
spring tool, and by rapid rotation thrown out into a disc
or foot by the agency of centrifugal force.’ The pontil is
now attached to the foot by means of a seal of molten
glass, and the upper bulb (the future bowl of the glass)
‘wetted off’ from the blowing-tube by the application of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_324' id='Page_324'>324</a></span>
a moistened iron. The glass, held by the pontil attached
to the foot, is completed by reheating the severed edges
of what is now the bowl, cutting them even with the
shears and rounding them by a second exposure to the
fire. The now completed wine-glass is finally separated
from the pontil by a jerk and taken to the annealing
oven. A rough edge remaining where the pontil was
attached is at the present day invariably smoothed by
grinding; not so, however, in the case of the older
glasses, and this is a point to be noted by the collector.
In Germany and Bohemia the rough edge of the bowl
after shearing is ground even on the wheel instead of
being rounded off in the furnace, and foreign-made glasses
may be often distinguished by their more angular rim.</p>

<p class='c001' >We shall now be in a better position to attack that
extensive and complicated series, the drinking-glasses of
the eighteenth century. Mr. Hartshorne, who in his
<cite>Old English Glasses</cite><a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c018'><sup>[253]</sup></a> has treated the subject in great
detail, mentions incidentally that he has made more than
a thousand full-sized outlines of glasses that have passed
through his hands. We must be content, then, to accept
the classification of such an authority, although some of
the divisions may seem a little arbitrary to one who has
no claim to be an expert. Thus out of sixteen families
of English eighteenth-century glass there are only two
that contain any objects other than drinking-glasses in
the narrower sense of the word; again, four or five of
the groups are based chiefly upon the liquor—wine, beer,
mead, mumm, syllabub, cider, cordial water, or punch—that
these glasses were presumably made to contain. In
a division of glasses from this latter point of view I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_325' id='Page_325'>325</a></span>
shall only mention three heads which alone seem to me
of sufficient importance to merit separate treatment—wine-glasses,
glasses for ale and beer, and glasses for
cordial waters—and even these, though varying in size,
pass through the same series of shapes in bowl and stem.
Again, a cross division may be made distinguishing the
ruder and somewhat more solid household and tavern
glasses from those destined for the table of the wealthy.</p>

<p class='c001' >The main lines, however, of the classification of these
drinking-glasses must be based upon the form of the
bowl and upon the outline and construction of the stem.
But first a word may be said of the relation of our
eighteenth-century glasses to their predecessors and contemporaries
on the Continent. On the whole, one may
conclude that the new forms and methods of decoration
grew up in Holland, in the Spanish Netherlands, or
again in the Liége district, towards the end of the
seventeenth century, when the old Italian influence was
giving way to processes and schemes of decoration that
had their origin in Germany and Bohemia. The methods
of the great firms of the Bonhommes and the De Colnets
were above all eclectic; the opaque-twisted stems of their
glasses were essentially of Venetian origin, the engraved
bowl had its prototype in Germany, and the material
finally—the ‘metal’—before long was English.</p>

<p class='c001' >In the case of the English glasses that followed in
the same lines, the greatest care seems to have been
given to the metal employed; next to that, the construction
of the stem and the outline of the bowl received attention;
on the other hand, the engraving on the bowl, compared
to the contemporary work in Germany and the Netherlands,
was for the most part of a summary, not to say
rude character. As for the foot, the margin was generally
slightly ‘welted’ or folded over from above, so that
the glass stands only on the rim; by this the solidity of
the foot is at the same time increased.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c018'><sup>[254]</sup></a> Otherwise the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_326' id='Page_326'>326</a></span>
only variation of importance in the shape of the foot
depends upon its greater or less flatness; in the earlier
glasses the central part generally rises up to form a
dome, upon which rests the base of the stem. The
square bases with plinth-like steps belong to a much later
time and are generally associated with facetted ware. It
may be noted that the glasses of the eighteenth century
stand on the whole on a relatively wider foot than those
now made.</p>

<p class='c001' >The first point of importance in considering the stem
is to distinguish those that are drawn—these are the
‘straw-shanks,’ formed of the same piece of metal as the
bowl—from the ‘stuck-shanks’ that are made of a
separate piece of glass. The latter form by far the
larger class. As regards the outline, the stem may be
either a plain rod or cylinder, or again of baluster
shape—this last but a modification of the double knops
that constitute the whole shank of some seventeenth-century
glasses. In other cases the stem is marked by
spiral lines in relief—that is to say, it is ‘rib-twisted,’
or, finally, it may be cut into flat facets. But perhaps
the most important division of the stems of our English
glasses is that based upon the nature of the spiral lines
of greater or less complexity so generally found in the
interior of the cylinder of glass. These lines may be
formed either by strings or bands of opaque white, or
more rarely of coloured glass, or again by empty threads
formed by drawing out a bubble of air. These are the
opaque-twisted and the air-twisted stems respectively.</p>

<p class='c001' >If now we turn to the outline of the main division of
the glass, the bowl, this has been made the basis of a
division that classes these bowls as straight-sided,
waisted, bell-shaped, and finally, bowls with a curve
resembling either the ogee or the double ogee of the
architect.</p>

<p class='c001' >The air-drawn stem, if not an English invention, was
certainly brought to great perfection here at an early
period. We must seek the origin of this device in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_327' id='Page_327'>327</a></span>
large ‘blows,’ often of very irregular shape, that fill the
knop or bulb on the stems of earlier glasses.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c018'><sup>[255]</sup></a> This
‘blow’ is sometimes prolonged into a sort of tail which
passes down nearly to the foot. In other cases we find
several smaller ‘tears’ in the same bulb, formed, it
appears, by puncturing, while it is still soft, the little
mass of glass destined to form the bulb, and then
covering it with a second gathering. These air-beaded
stems are mostly of Low Country origin; but they are of
interest to us, as we may probably regard them as the
starting-point of the air-twists which are formed by
drawing out and twisting the original spherical mass,
containing one or more of these bubbles or tears. It
may be mentioned that in a general way a loose, widely
spaced spiral is characteristic of the earlier glasses, while
the tightly twisted stems are only found on late examples.
This applies also to the spirals on the rib-twisted stems
of plain glass. There is another point that should not
be overlooked: this is that the twist on eighteenth-century
glasses always descends from right to left, while
in modern imitations the reverse direction is generally
taken.</p>

<p class='c001' >Perhaps the earliest type of English glass is one with
a waisted bowl, engraved with a full-blown rose, and
supported on a rib-twisted stem; but those on stems
loosely air-twisted may sometimes be as old.</p>

<p class='c001' >There is a glass in the British Museum with a bell-shaped
bowl engraved with a rose, a pink, and a third
flower of undetermined species; this we may take as a
good type of the earlier drinking-glass. The bowl is
divided from the air-twisted stem by a hollow bulb containing
a sixpence of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> dated 1679. It will be
noted how closely the berry-like stamps on the bulb
resemble the prunts on the stem of a <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">roemer</span></i>; they occur
again on the already mentioned posset-cup from Chastleton.
Such decoration may, perhaps, be regarded as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_328' id='Page_328'>328</a></span>
characteristic of the English glass of the end of the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p class='c001' >The opaque-twisted stem formed, on the same system
as the Venetian <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetro di trina</span></i>, from rods containing
threads of opaque white glass or <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">latticinio</span></i>, is on the other
hand not a specially English type. Such stems were in
great favour in the Low Countries and in the north of
France, and it is even possible that the rods of glass
from which our English examples are formed may have
been imported from Venice or from the Netherlands.<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c018'><sup>[256]</sup></a>
The white lines are sometimes combined with air-twists
to form complicated patterns.</p>

<p class='c001' >The glasses with straight-sided bowls may, on the
whole, be attributed to an early period, and together with
the contemporary bell-shaped glasses they constitute an
essentially English class. Those again with the so-called
ogee bowls are especially associated with the Bristol
glass-houses. Glasses with bowls of this outline form
nearly one-third of the extensive collection of Mr. Singer,
which was formed for the most part, as I have already
mentioned, in the neighbourhood of that town.</p>

<p class='c001' >I now turn to the engraved designs that are found
upon the bowls of most of these eighteenth-century
glasses. There is not much to be said for the inventive
powers or for the technical skill shown by the engraver.
Indeed, considering the general low level of the engraved
work, there is some temptation to find a Dutch or
Flemish origin for any specimen of engraving that
shows superior technical or artistic qualities; and there
is little doubt that in the case of the earlier pieces at
least, such an attribution would be justified.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c018'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >The design that we find most frequently on our
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_329' id='Page_329'>329</a></span>
eighteenth-century glasses is a rose branch with, on the
opposite side, a butterfly. This motive is found on
the bell-shaped bowls of early glasses with air-twisted
stems. With certain modifications it continued long in
use. The rose, with the change of fashion after the
middle of the century, became more naturalistic, and the
butterfly often takes the form of a moth. Other designs
have reference to the beverage destined to be drunk from
the glass: for wine-glasses, bunches of grapes and vine-leaves
(often accompanied by a humming-bird); ears of
barley for beer-glasses; and in the few rare cases where
an apple-tree forms part of the design, we may associate
the glass with cider. The popular cries—‘No Excise,’
or ‘Wilkes and Liberty’ and ‘No. 45’—which are sometimes
found on glasses towards the middle of the
century,<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c018'><sup>[258]</sup></a> remind us of the new fashion that came in
about that time of finding in the decoration of pottery or
other ware an opportunity for political propaganda, and
for the glorification of the hero of the day. There was
not much to be done in this way on the restricted space
at command on the bowls of our glasses; towards the
end of the century, however, naval emblems are frequently
to be found, and the Nelson glasses form a
group by themselves.</p>

<p class='c001' >But of all the glasses that are thus ‘made to speak,’
to use the expression of the great Napoleon, who had
strong opinions as to the advantages of this method of
political <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réclame</span></i>, the most interesting class is formed by the
treasured Jacobite glasses, bearing mottoes and emblems
of a more or less cryptic character, or, more rarely, portraits
of the young or the old Pretender engraved on the
bowl.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c018'><sup>[259]</sup></a> The extraordinary fascination exercised over
some minds by what George Borrow used to call ‘Charlie-over-the-waterism,’
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_330' id='Page_330'>330</a></span>
is nowhere better exhibited than in
the almost devotional tone with which this subject is
approached by more than one of our authorities. The
more important of these glasses, especially the large ones
with drawn stems, and those with baluster or rather
double-knopped stems, are probably of foreign origin;
at all events they were engraved in the north of France
or in the Low Countries. Of the rare examples with the
head of the young Pretender surrounded by a wreath of
laurels, there are very few specimens in our public
museums: I can only call to mind a small glass from
the Schreiber collection at South Kensington and one
or two examples lately presented to the British Museum
(<a href='#p44'>Plate <span class='fss'>XLIV.</span></a>). The most frequent emblem is the rose with
two buds, traditionally, I believe, regarded as symbolical
of James <span class='fss'>II.</span> with his son and grandson, although to one
not in the inner circle of the cause the relation of the
equipoised buds to the central flower would seem rather
to point to the old Pretender and his two sons Charles
Edward and Henry.<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c018'><sup>[260]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >As to the inscriptions on these glasses, we find in one
instance four stanzas from the Jacobite version of ‘God
save the King’ engraved on the bowl. But in most
cases the allusion to the cause is of a more disguised
character. The commonest of all is the single word
‘<span class='sc'>Fiat</span>,’ the motto of the Jacobite society known as the
Cycle, which flourished in the west of England during
the greater part of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class='c001' >I may note that among the Jacobite glasses
treasured up in many an old house in the west and
north of England, one rarely comes across any example
that cannot be classed more or less accurately as a wine-glass.
Quite exceptional is the decanter engraved with
a circular compass-card pointing to a star, between oak
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_331' id='Page_331'>331</a></span>
leaves and roses (Hartshorne, Plate 64). This decanter
is one of a pair preserved, along with as many as eleven
of the above mentioned ‘Fiat’ glasses, in the early
Jacobean house at Chastleton, on the borders of Oxfordshire
and Worcestershire.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c018'><sup>[261]</sup></a> Here also are many other
pieces of old English glass to more than one of which
I have already referred.</p>

<p class='c001' >Although the history of English glass during the
eighteenth century—it would be more accurate perhaps
to say from about 1670 to 1770—tends always to fall
back upon the drinking-glass, yet during that time the
material was applied also to the manufacture of many
other objects. We find in the earlier records frequent
reference to large vessels of glass, blown or cast; this
was indeed the case as far back as the time when
Chiddingfold was the centre of glass-making. A
favourite form at the end of the seventeenth century—but
here again a drinking-glass—was the ‘yard,’ an
exaggerated outgrowth of the Venetian or Low Country
‘flute.’ Thus Evelyn, describing the ceremonies on the
occasion of the proclamation of James <span class='fss'>II.</span>, says that
at Bromley the king’s health was ‘drunk in a flint glasse
of a yard long.’ Some time before this, in 1669, on the
occasion of a visit to the glass-house at Blackfriars, the
same writer mentions the ‘singing glasses’ that he there
had made for him, and which ‘make an echo to the
voice ...’ but ‘were so thin that the very breath broke
one or two of them.’ At a later time trumpets were
made of glass, and some of these have survived.</p>

<p class='c001' >But few examples, however, of what may be called
miscellaneous glass of an earlier date than the seventies
of the eighteenth century have been preserved. It was
about this time that a great change must have come over
the manufacture, though on this point we have strangely
little direct information. This period, we know, was a
critical one in the history of the minor arts both in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_332' id='Page_332'>332</a></span>
England and in France. In the latter country, the
simpler and more classical style associated with the
reign of Louis <span class='fss'>XVI.</span> replaced the more unrestrained forms
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louis Quinze</span></i> period some years before the death
of the latter king. In England we see the new shapes
first in the work of the silversmith about the year 1770,
and soon after they are well represented in the Chelsea-Derby
porcelain. In the case of glass this change is
above all to be associated with the increased use of
facetting. Flat facets divided by obtuse angles may
indeed be found at times on the stems and shoulders of
drinking-glasses almost from the commencement of the
century. But now these facets take a purely geometrical
form. The dishes and basins of the time simply bristle
with sharp-pointed pyramids, so that these heavy, solid
vessels can scarcely be lifted with impunity.</p>

<p class='c001' >Now for the first time full advantage was taken of
the power possessed by the heavy lead-glass of dispersing
the rays of light, for only by the use of these
facets was the full fire of the glass developed. This is
indeed—so at least it seems to me—the one really important
period in the history of English glass. It was
not long after this time, towards the end of the century,
that use was for the first time made of machinery for
driving the grinding-wheels. The glass, whose general
outline had been previously determined in the mould,
was now quickly channelled with intersecting furrows.
There is at South Kensington a small collection of the
earlier facetted glass, presented by Mr. H. B. Lennard,
which contains some pieces of real artistic merit. This
was the period when the square plinth-like base was in
fashion—not perhaps in itself a very desirable form. In
the Lennard collection are two carved cups with these
square feet: the bowl in each case is surrounded by
deeply cut gadroons curving as they descend; on other
parts the usual facets are found (<a href='#p45'>Plate <span class='fss'>XLV.</span></a> 1). There is
a fine sculpturesque feeling about the treatment of these
standing cups that carries one back to far earlier days—in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_333' id='Page_333'>333</a></span>
fact I know of no other specimens of English glass
where such full advantage has been taken of the
qualities of the material, and this without any abuse or
exaggeration.<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c018'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >But for the most part—above all after the end of the
century—the facetting runs wild; sometimes it covers
the whole surface, and even where there are no facets
the ground is marked out by rectangular divisions. The
decoration as a whole is mechanically executed. But
even this machine-made work is better than the cheap
imitations of later days produced by pressing the glass
into moulds of metal.</p>

<p class='c001' >The cutting, or rather the grinding, of the glass was
effected on a cast-iron wheel. A number of these wheels
were fixed on a horizontal shaft; a workman seated in
front of each held the glass against the revolving face.
The actual abrading in such a case is done by the gritty
particles of the sand, which mixed with water falls in a
continuous stream from the hopper above. After smoothing
on a stone wheel, the surface was polished on a wheel
or ‘lap’ of willow-wood (or sometimes of lead), first by
means of pumice or rotten stone and then with putty
powder. Engraving, in the Bohemian or German sense,
held a subordinate position, and when made use of, for
the better sort of work at least, foreigners were generally
employed. The outlines were then cut by minute copper
wheels with the aid of finely pulverised emery powder
mixed with oil, as in the case of the German glass.<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c018'><sup>[263]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >As I have said, it was above all this facetted ware—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’article
Anglais, solide et comfortable mais sans
élégance</span></i>,’ as a French writer calls it—that spread the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_334' id='Page_334'>334</a></span>
renown of English glass through the length and breadth
of Europe.</p>

<p class='c001' >At that time the famous English flint-glass was made
by mixing three parts of pure sand, well washed and
burned (from Alum Bay, Lynn, or Reigate), with two
parts of red lead or litharge and one part of carbonate of
potash. A small fraction of saltpetre and a little oxide
of manganese were subsequently added to cleanse the
metal. The potash, up to the middle of the last century,
was introduced in the form of pearl-ash imported from
Canada or Russia, and the litharge came from the
refineries where silver was extracted from the native lead.
In fusing the glass, great importance was attached to the
quick melting of the materials at the full heat of the
furnace, and to the subsequent rapid working of the pot.
Our English glass industry was nearly ruined by the
enormous excise duties, collected on the most arbitrary
and artificial system, to which it was subjected both
before and after the close of the great war. When on
the repeal of these taxes the industry ‘rose from its
ashes,’ it was conducted on a purely commercial basis.</p>

<p class='c001' >I have already called attention to the important part
played by Bristol in the manufacture of glass during the
eighteenth century. That town obtained at this time a
unique distinction in the history of English glass, as the
one spot where a distinct kind of ware—a special <i>genre</i>—was
made. It cannot be precisely stated when the
opaque white glass decorated with enamel colours was
first made at Bristol; what record we have does not take
us further back than the latter half of the eighteenth
century. This glass was apparently very brittle, and
would not stand heat, a fact which may account for the
few examples that have survived. In general character
the Bristol <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">lattimo</span></i> closely resembles the other imitations
of porcelain made with glass, which were so much in
vogue at the beginning of the century. I have already
mentioned the opaque white glass of Orleans, of Barcelona,
and of Venice. Mr. Hugh Owen has collected at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_335' id='Page_335'>335</a></span>
the end of his excellent work on Bristol porcelain (<cite>Two
Centuries of Ceramic Art in Bristol</cite>, 1873) some curious
information about this glass, from the account-book of a
local enameller, one Edkins. The ledger in question
contains entries from 1762 to 1787. According to an
analysis made by Professor Church, the opaque Bristol
glass contains an exceptionally large quantity of lead—as
much as 44 per cent., it would seem—and, what is
certainly remarkable, less than one per cent. of tin. It is
to this substance, however, seeing that neither phosphate
of lime nor arsenic<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c018'><sup>[264]</sup></a> is present, that we must attribute
its opacity.</p>

<p class='c001' >Mr. Owen thinks that in whiteness and in softness of
texture this Bristol ware exceeds all other opaque glasses
of the kind, and comes nearer than any of them in aspect
to the soft-paste porcelain of the day. According to the
papers left by the above-mentioned Edkins, the better
kinds—these were above all tea-poys, enamel-painted in
the manner of the contemporary Bristol porcelain—were
decorated in the usual way with coloured fluxes melted
on in the muffle-stove. But the common articles ‘were
simply painted with oil colours mixed with a desiccator
and dried hard by artificial heat.’<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c018'><sup>[265]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >In the Schreiber collection at South Kensington may
be seen a pair of candlesticks with twisted stems made of
this white opaque Bristol glass. They are well painted
with flowers and butterflies on a white chalky ground.
At a later time some passable imitations of Venetian
glass decorated with white threads in a ruby ground
were made at Bristol, as well as bottles splashed with
purple, black, and white, after the manner of a French
and Venetian ware of the seventeenth century that has
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_336' id='Page_336'>336</a></span>
already been described. The glass-works at Nailsea,
nine miles south-west of Bristol, were established in
1788 and survived to the middle of the last century. To
the earlier years of these works may be attributed some
jugs of yellowish-green glass, with large splashes of
white, that turn up at times in the west of England.</p>

<p class='c001' >James Tassie (born 1735), the Glasgow stonemason,
applied the experience he had gained in the modelling of
portrait heads in wax to the reproduction of antique
gems in coloured pastes. The bright colours of these
compare unfavourably with the delicate hues of the glass
intaglios that have come down from classical times.
But Tassie, both James and his nephew William, also
made portrait medallions of a comparatively large size,
using a nearly opaque glass paste or frit, more or less
resembling porcelain. This paste was formed, it is said,
of ‘a finely powdered glass and finely powdered pigments,
annealed by being placed in a reverbatory furnace.’ This
is a substance of some interest to us, and we may perhaps
find in it points of resemblance to the ‘<em>pâte de verre</em>’
employed lately by M. Henri Cros (see <a href='#ch22'>Chap. <span class='fss'>XXII.</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c001' >I can only mention one other local variety of glass.
In Ireland, towards the end of the eighteenth century,
more than one attempt was made to encourage the manufacture.
Some large fruit-dishes of heavy cut-glass, and
others in the form of open baskets adorned with festoons,
have been traced back to glass-houses established at
Waterford about the year 1780. This glass is distinguished
by a more or less faint blue tinge derived from a
minute quantity of cobalt in the ‘metal.’ The gilding
that was largely applied to these vessels was burned in by
means of borax, and where the gold has come away the
surface of the glass is rough and pitted.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_8 c006'     >I shall now devote a short chapter to the glass
made in Asia, that is to say in Persia, in India,
and in China, in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries.</p>

<p class='c001' >This later Asiatic glass, though so thoroughly Oriental
in character, can as a whole scarcely be regarded as a
product of strictly indigenous growth, for in nearly all
cases the technique of the manufacture, in some indeed
the materials and even the ‘metal’ itself, can be traced
back to Europe. It is for this reason that I have reserved
its treatment to this late stage.</p>

<p class='c001' >We are fortunate in possessing in the Oriental
galleries at South Kensington, as well as in the British
Museum, a comparatively rich series of examples of this
later Oriental glass, not a few of them of great beauty
and interest. As a class it can probably be studied
nowhere so well as in London.</p>

<p class='c001' >The Chinese glass of the eighteenth century is above
all of interest to us, for upon it more than upon anything
else is based the only new departure in the treatment of
the material that the nineteenth century can lay claim to—the
‘New Glass,’ I mean, that has taken so important
a place of late among the minor art products of France.
It is therefore not altogether illogical that this glass of
the Far East should find a place in our history between
the English glass of the eighteenth century and that now
being made in France.</p>

<p class='c001' >The glorious enamelled glass of the Saracens, of which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_338' id='Page_338'>338</a></span>
I have given some account in a former chapter, was
already a thing of the past before the end of the fifteenth
century. This was at least the case in Syria and Egypt,
where alone the art as we know it had flourished. I
have attributed this sudden decline, as regards the first
country, to the invasion of Timur early in the century.
On this occasion a whole army of craftsmen was transferred,
it is said, from Damascus to Timur’s new capital
at Samarkand. In Egypt the narrow-minded fanaticism
of the later Memlûk Sultans and the troubles that preceded
the Turkish conquest were doubtless factors in
the artistic decline. As far as the Mohammedan East is
concerned, there is thus an obscure period in our history
extending to the end of the sixteenth century for which
there is little or nothing to show. Glass of some sort
doubtless continued to be made in Syria, and perhaps in
Egypt, but little that is distinctive or of artistic interest
was produced.</p>

<p class='c001' >When we again come upon specimens of Oriental
glass, it is no longer in the Mediterranean countries but
in Persia, and to a less extent in Northern India, that we
find them. Not only so, but the glass that we now have
to deal with is of an entirely different character. With
a few rare exceptions, the thick jewel-like enamels of the
Syro-Egyptian school are now as much a thing of the
past as the carved glass of a still earlier time.</p>

<p class='c001' >The <span class='sc'>Persian Glass</span> of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries is, as a whole, thin and transparent, either
simply blown or in part moulded. In spite of the purely
Oriental character of the outlines of this glass, the influence
of Venetian methods in the preparation and modes
of working is in most cases apparent. As I have said,
it would be out of the question to treat of this later
Oriental glass, little of which is probably earlier than the
seventeenth century, before we had acquired some knowledge
of the renaissance glass of Italy.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c001' >Whether Timur or his successors succeeded in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_339' id='Page_339'>339</a></span>
establishing the Syrian glass industry in the Khanates
of Turkestan we do not know. There is a vague tradition
that in the fifteenth century the glass of Samarkand
was the finest in the East. It is, however, to a much
later time that the earliest specimens of what I may call
the Veneto-Persian family of glass belong—to the time
of the Sufi dynasty in Persia and to that of the Moguls
in Northern India.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of Persian glass there indeed still exist a few rare
examples which may perhaps date from an earlier time.
I have already referred (p. <a href='#Page_172'>172</a>) to the little drinking-bowl
of honey-coloured glass in the British Museum decorated
with enamels of good quality—turquoise, red and white
(<a href='#p27'>Plate <span class='fss'>XXVII.</span></a> 1). The figure of an angel upon it is
thoroughly Persian in character; not only in the enamels,
but in the horny quality of the honey-coloured metal, this
little bowl closely resembles the spherical lamp ornament
mentioned on p. <a href='#Page_156'>156</a>, that has very properly been placed
beside it on the shelf of the Museum.</p>

<p class='c001' >Among the few pieces of later Oriental glass in the
Slade collection is a small covered bowl, probably of
Persian origin, with a formal design of iris and other
flowers. In spite of the somewhat modern air of this
bowl, due perhaps to the solid and rather crude gilding,
the thick, semi-transparent enamels, blue and pale green,
take us back to the earlier Saracenic work.</p>

<p class='c001' >But such examples are quite exceptional. As a rule,
on the glass brought back from Persia—there is quite
a large collection at South Kensington and a few choice
pieces in the British Museum—the enamelling, if present
at all, is of the poorest description—it belongs essentially
to our ‘painted’ class. This enamelled decoration, as on
some little bottles at South Kensington, appears to be
but a rude imitation of the floral patterns that we see, for
example, on the lacquered bindings of Persian books.</p>

<p class='c001' >On the other hand, the tall-necked flasks of thin glass—scent-sprinklers
and wine-bottles—give proof of considerable
manipulative skill (<a href='#p47'>Plate <span class='fss'>XLVII.</span></a>). To judge by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_340' id='Page_340'>340</a></span>
the patterns in low relief on the sides, many of these
vases, in spite of the thinness of the glass, must have
been blown into a mould. The tall neck ends either in a
flat-spreading lip or is bent over into that characteristic
Persian form—not unlike the head of a bird with large
beak—of which we may see an imitation or at least a
kindred shape in certain Venetian double-necked cruets.
At one time a fashion prevailed of fitting into the interior
of these thin flasks elaborate bouquets of flowers built up
with coloured enamels of opaque glass, a somewhat
childish fancy, reflecting the weaker side of later Persian
art.</p>

<p class='c001' >Of more interest is the ruder glass, often decorated
with a profusion of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appliqué</span></i> strips, quilled and worked
up with the pincers. In such examples we are strikingly
reminded both of a class of peasant glass from the South
of Spain, and again of the late Roman glass from the
Rhine and other districts.</p>

<p class='c001' >On the other hand, certain bowls and vases of deep
blue glass, decorated with floral designs in a solid gilding,
have an almost unpleasantly modern air. A pair
of vases so decorated, now in the British Museum, came,
however, from the Strawberry Hill collection, and they
may well date from the early eighteenth century.</p>

<p class='c001' >Finally, I will mention a remarkable variety of glass
worked generally into the form of tall, thin-necked flasks;
within the greenish transparent metal float irregular
masses of an opaque deep red. We have here, in fact,
the elements of which the famous Chinese glazes—the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flambé</span></i> and the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang-de-bœuf</span></i>—are made up. As in these
glazes, so in this case in the glass, the effect doubtless
depends on the partial reduction of the incorporated
copper-oxide.</p>

<p class='c001' >I should add that engraved glass seems never to have
found much favour with the Persians. On the few
specimens that we have in our collections—they are
decorated with birds and flowers rudely ground on the
wheel—the work is of the poorest description.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c001' >I have so far taken it for granted that the bulk of this
glass is of comparatively modern origin, and I have
found confirmation for this opinion in the close relation
of so much of it to the glass made at Murano in the
seventeenth century. Still more definite evidence is,
however, at hand, as the following passage from the
travels of Sir John Chardin will show.<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c018'><sup>[266]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >‘There are Glass-Houses all over Persia, but most of
the Glass is full of Flaws and Bladders and is Greyish
from the account doubtless that the Fire lasts but three
or four days, and that their <i>Deremne</i> as they call it,
which is a sort of Broom, which they use to make it,
does not bear heat so well as ours. The Glass of <i>Chiras</i>
is the finest in the Country; that of <i>Ispahan</i> on the
contrary is the sorriest, because it is only glass melted
again. They make it commonly in Spring. They do not
understand to Silver their Glass over, therefore their
Glass Looking-glasses are brought from <i>Venise</i>, as also
their sash glasses [<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">glaces de châssis</span></i>] and their pretty
Snuff-Bottles. Moreover, the Art of Glass-making was
brought into Persia within these last four score Years.
A Beggarly and Covetous Italian taught it at <i>Chiras</i> for
the sum of fifty Crowns. Had I not been informed of
the matter, I should have thought that they had been
beholded to the Portuguese for their Skill in so noble
and so useful an Art. I ought not to forget to acquaint
you with the Persian Art of Sowing Glass together very
ingeniously, ... for provided the Pieces be not smaller
than one’s Nail, they sow them together with Wyre and
rub the seam over with a little white Lead or with
calcined Lime, mixed with White of Egg, which hinders
the water from soaking thro. Among their Sentences
there is a goodly one relating to the ingenious piece of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_342' id='Page_342'>342</a></span>
work just mentioned: <em>If broken glass be restored again,
how much more may Man be restored again after his
Dissolution in the Grave?</em>’</p>

<p class='c019' >Closely connected with this Persian glass is the deep
amber or honey-coloured glass, said to have been made
in the island of <span class='sc'>Rhodes</span>. A small collection of rudely
executed bottles, pilgrims’ flasks and bowls, obtained in
that island and in Cyprus, may be seen at South Kensington;
they are there ascribed to the sixteenth century,
I do not know on what grounds. These little vessels are
all of the simplest shapes, such as could be formed directly
from the <i>paraison</i> at the end of the blowing-iron, without
removing the glass to the pontil. Some small hand-grenades
of greenish black or of opaque jasper glass in
the British Museum, come for the most part from
Cyprus.</p>

<p class='c019' >I may here say a word of the glass still in use in the
Mohammedan East. At the present day the glass-works
at Hebron, which I have already more than once mentioned,
supply most of the common native glass in use
both in Egypt and Syria<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c018'><sup>[267]</sup></a>—of that of European origin
<a id='three'></a>there is no need to speak. Edward Lane describes the
small conical lamps of thin glass ‘having a little tube
at the bottom in which is stuck a wick twisted round
a piece of straw.’ This is an old type of lamp that
I have dwelt upon in a former chapter. Perhaps the
most interesting form of glass vessel now in use in Cairo
and Damascus is the covered sherbet-jug or bowl—the
<i>Kulleh</i>. I have before me an example from Cairo made
of a nearly opaque white glass, decorated with floral
designs rudely painted on and perhaps not fired. Where
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_343' id='Page_343'>343</a></span>
this glass is made I do not know. We may perhaps
regard the ware as a survival of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">lattimo</span></i> of the early
eighteenth century (cf. Lane, <cite>Modern Egyptians</cite>, 1842,
vol. i. p. 224).</p>

<small>INDIAN, SEVENTEENTH OR EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</small></p>
</div></div>

<p class='c019' ><span class='sc'>Indian Glass.</span>—The classical writers had a tradition
that the best glass in the world was made in India,
thanks above all to the use of a pure rock crystal in the
manufacture. There are some vague references to glass
in the later Sanscrit literature, and in one of the older,
but not the oldest, of the Hindu books, a distinction is
made between a vessel of glass and one made of crystal.
But it would be useless to search in the Hindustan of
to-day for any examples of so early a date. Apart from
a few beads which may be assigned to Buddhist times,<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c018'><sup>[268]</sup></a> I
can point to no examples of Indian glass of earlier date
than the Mogul dynasty. It is to that period—hardly,
indeed, before the later seventeenth century—that we
must attribute certain remarkable examples of glass,
found for the most part in Delhi, which are now in the
Indian Department at South Kensington. There may be
seen an example of enamelled glass of great beauty
(<a href='#p48'>Plate <span class='fss'>XLVIII.</span></a>). This is a vase of somewhat milky glass
with spreading mouth, some eleven inches in diameter;
it is described as a washing-basin; the gilt ground is
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">semé</span></i> with little white flowers, each with a red pistil. Of
no less interest are the two hookah-bases of engraved
white glass. On these the technique of the engraved
work—but not the Oriental design of conventional flowers—much
resembles that of the Bohemian cut-glass; there
are no incised lines, and the oval depressions representing
the leaves are carefully polished. Unlike the engraved
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_344' id='Page_344'>344</a></span>
glass of Persia, the work shows signs of a complete
mastery of the process. It will be noticed that in the
case of one of these vessels the clear <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> is unchanged,
while in the other the glass is, as it were, frosted,
apparently by the incipient decay of the surface. In the
same case may be seen some tall vases of thin white
glass, of a type very similar to the Persian sprinklers.
These also come from Northern India.</p>

<p class='c001' >It would be useless to search for an early native
origin for work of this kind. Were it, however, possible
to find in India any glass that we could connect with the
Turki Khanates of Bokhara and Samarkand, the old
homes of the Mogul family, we should thereby be provided
with a connecting link that would not unlikely
carry us back to the Syrian enamelled glass of the fourteenth
century (see above, p. <a href='#Page_168'>168</a>). But nothing of the
kind, as far as I know, has so far turned up in Hindustan.
On the whole, this Mogul glass, in spite of the exceptional
artistic and technical qualities of the specimens
just described, belongs to that bastard school of Saracenic
art that is prevalent generally in the north of India. Its
artistic parentage may probably be traced back to Venice
by way of Persia. Equally Persian in character are the
four-sided bottles painted with figures and flowers, somewhat
in the style of the Cashmiri lacquer. A remarkable
series of little flasks of this character, formerly in the
Marryat collection, may be seen in the Indian Department
at South Kensington, where, however, they are
described as ‘Indo-Dutch.’</p>

<p class='c001' >It is certainly disappointing to find in India such a
total absence of native glass with any claim to antiquity.
But some consolation may be derived from the discovery—for
discovery it may be called—made not many years
ago, that in more than one part of Hindustan, native
craftsmen were turning out vessels of glass by a
strangely primitive method. Sir Purdon Clarke, who
has always had at heart the maintenance of the native
industries of the country on the old lines, tells me that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_345' id='Page_345'>345</a></span>
this modern Indian glass was first noticed at Calcutta,
and with some difficulty traced to Patna. Here, by the
most primitive methods, the native workmen were turning
out among other things imitations of European lamp-glasses.
The furnace consisted of a series of elaborate
passages hidden beneath a heap of ashes. These
chambers were originally formed by a scaffolding of
cardboard frames which, when the arrangement was
completed, were set on fire.</p>

<p class='c001' >Somewhat more ambitious are the furnaces which
Mr. H. C. Dobbs found in use in the neighbourhood of
Benares and Lucknow (<cite>Journal of Indian Art</cite>, vol. vii.).
The material here employed was either imported or
‘country’ glass, but we are not told how the latter was
prepared. The little circular ovens, less than five feet in
height, are rudely built up of clay; there are two cylindrical
chambers back to back, each of two stories, but of
the four compartments thus formed three are devoted to
the gradual cooling of the wares. It seems doubtful
whether in these furnaces the glass is ever thoroughly
melted, and though use is certainly made, in a primitive
way, of the blowing-tube, the method of working resembles
rather the treatment of a piece of iron in the
blacksmith’s forge. The glass is constantly reheated and
patted and pressed.<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c018'><sup>[269]</sup></a> We are, indeed, reminded of the
preparation of the Egyptian glass of the Eighteenth
Dynasty, as interpreted by Dr. Petrie (cf. p. <a href='#Page_22'>22</a>). How
far the Indian glass-maker in his methods of work is
carrying on an old native tradition, or how far he is
merely adapting what he has learned from Persian or
European glass-blowers to the exigencies of his surroundings,
I must leave an open question. I think,
however, that in nearly all cases his starting-point is
either with a mass of imported ‘metal,’ or with fragments
of broken glass.</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_346' id='Page_346'>346</a></span>
In the Indian Department at South Kensington may
be seen a most remarkable collection of this native
glass, obtained in part from Patna and in part from
Hoshiarpur, in the Punjab.<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c018'><sup>[270]</sup></a> This glass is of the greatest
interest and should be closely examined. It is for the
most part of various shades of blue and green, but these
shades seem to be due to copper rather than to iron; at
least we do not meet with the well-known olive greens
derived from the latter metal. But the most striking
peculiarity—the charm, I may say—of this glass is due
to the presence of minute bubbles, so numerous and
closely packed that the glass is little better than translucent.
To the presence of these bubbles is also due the
peculiar waxy aspect of the surface, and this with the
irregular outline lends to this simple ware a plastic
appearance as if moulded by the hand. Some use is
made also of an opaque yellow glass, and among the
examples from Patna are some decorated with bands of
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">lattimo</span></i>. The shapes call for no special comment: I will
only point to certain curious little scorpion-shaped scent-bottles
with twisted tails, and to the large torque bangles,
as worthy of notice. Of greater interest is the primitive
arrangement for distilling—a combination of aludel and
alembic that calls to mind the illustrations to the Syriac
manuscripts that I have mentioned in a former chapter.
Perhaps the principal charm of this native Indian glass
arises from the violent contrast that it affords to the
impeccable <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cristallo</span></i> and to the flint-glass that have
tyrannised over us so long in Europe. It is beginning
at length to dawn upon us that there are other qualities
than absolute transparency and absence of colour to be
looked for in our material, and it is the attempt to bring
these qualities into prominence that has led to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_347' id='Page_347'>347</a></span>
development in France within the last few years of quite
a new treatment of glass.</p>

<p class='c019' ><span class='sc'>Glass in China.</span><a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c018'><sup>[271]</sup></a>—There are frequent references in
Chinese literature to a substance called <i>liu-li</i>, which the
best authorities tell us may be regarded as a more or less
opaque variety of glass. This <i>liu-li</i> is, in the old books,
always closely associated with rock crystal and jade, and
was, indeed, like these stones, classed among the ‘seven
precious things’; we also find it described as ‘thousand
year old ice.’ When towards the end of the first century
of our era an attempt was made by the emperors of the
Han dynasty to establish commercial relations with the
Roman West, this <i>liu-li</i> was one of the substances most
sought after. The Chinese of this time were, it would
seem, acquainted with the Roman Empire, but probably
only with the eastern provinces. The Ta-tsin of their
early writers has been identified by Dr. Hirth with Syria,
and its capital Antu with Antioch: in these parts at that
time they would have had no difficulty in obtaining the
glass that they were in search of. It is indeed not
impossible that it may have been this new and exotic
material that first turned their attention to the glazing
of their pottery, for it is doubtful if they were acquainted
with the process before this time.</p>

<p class='c001' >Again, in the fifth century some merchants who
visited North-west India are said to have learned there
the secrets of glass-making, and on their return to China
to have produced <i>liu-li</i> of all colours by the smelting of
various minerals. Once more, in the thirteenth century,
we hear of glass being made by the melting together of
certain stones and drugs, and the word <i>po-li</i>—the name
given generally to transparent glass, in opposition to the
more or less opaque <i>liu-li</i>—is now used for the first time.</p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_348' id='Page_348'>348</a></span>
On the other hand, in the annals of the Sui dynasty
(581-617) we are told that China had long lost the art of
making glass, but that a high official of the court succeeded
at that time in fashioning vessels of green porcelain
that could not be distinguished from <i>liu-li</i> (Bushell,
<cite>Chinese Ceramic Art</cite>, p. 20). The inference that we
must draw from these contradictory statements is probably
that, in spite of many assertions to the contrary,<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c018'><sup>[272]</sup></a>
the art of glass-making was never thoroughly acclimatised
in China till much later times. And this conclusion is
confirmed by the total absence in our collections of any
examples of glass of native manufacture that can be referred
to a date earlier than the eighteenth century.<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c018'><sup>[273]</sup></a> For although
we know that after the return of Marco Polo both the
Venetians and Genoese found in China a market for
their beads, if not for more important objects of glass,
and that early in the fifteenth century specimens of
Saracenic enamelled glass found their way to the Chinese
ports, the evidence that any true glass was at that time
made in China is of the vaguest character.<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c018'><sup>[274]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >When we come to the eighteenth century we are on
firmer ground. Before the end of the seventeenth century
glass-works had been established under the superintendence
of the Jesuit missionaries, within the precincts of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_349' id='Page_349'>349</a></span>
the Imperial Palace at Pekin. At a later time, not long
after the accession of Kien-lung (1735-1795), we hear of
a famous glass-worker, one Hu.<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c018'><sup>[275]</sup></a> This Hu was a craftsman
in the Imperial glass-works, and there made both
‘a clear glass of greenish tint with an embossed decoration
executed in coloured glass, and an opaque white glass
which was either engraved with etched designs or decorated
in colours’ (Bushell, <cite>Oriental Ceramic Art</cite>, p. 400).
It is a significant fact that though the emperor much
admired the glass of Hu, his first thought was to have it
imitated in porcelain, the more noble material.</p>

<p class='c001' >Let us now turn to the specimens of Chinese glass
that we find in our museums. What is probably the
largest and most representative collection in Europe is
now in the Museum of Industrial Art at Berlin. Here
are more than four hundred examples brought together
by the care of Herr von Brandt, formerly German
minister at Pekin.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c018'><sup>[276]</sup></a> Smaller but representative collections
of Chinese glass may be seen both at South Kensington
and in the British Museum.</p>

<p class='c001' >On a few of these pieces is found the date-mark—the
<i>nien-hao</i>—of the reigning emperor engraved on the base.
As far as I am aware, the earliest mark so found is that of
Yung-Ching (1722-1735), on a vase in the Berlin Museum.
The name of Kia-King (1795-1821) has also been noted,
but by far the most frequent mark is that of Kien-lung
(1735-1795), of whom I have already spoken in connection
with Hu of ‘the ancient moon.’ Probably most of
our finest specimens of Chinese glass date from the
second half of the eighteenth century, and to that period
we may no doubt refer a series of magnificent examples
of blown glass at South Kensington. These large pieces,
of such excellent metal and showing so complete a command
of technique, may probably be regarded, in spite of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_350' id='Page_350'>350</a></span>
the Arabic inscriptions found on one or two of them, as
a result of the teaching of the Jesuit missionaries; they
were perhaps made by remelting imported glass. Notice
especially the huge bowl or flower-pot with scalloped
edge, built up, by some sort of ‘casing’ process, of two
layers of glass, the inner, nearly opaque, of pale blue,
the outer, dark blue and transparent. This bowl bears
the date-mark of Kien-lung and is a triumph of technical
skill. Not less remarkable are the two large vases of
deep purple glass, bearing on the sides and necks large
medallions with Arabic inscriptions in relief on a ground
apparently chipped with a tool.<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c018'><sup>[277]</sup></a> Of even greater interest
are the two covered bowls of transparent cobalt glass
with a quaint design built up of the smooth Chinese
dragon or salamander and of the character for ‘long life.’
The part not engraved is curiously wrinkled or pitted, so
as to form a sort of epidermis on the surface—by what
means I do not know. The Chinese succeeded in making
a yellow glass of a fine deep tint; a variety of this with
opaque spots—the ‘rice-grain’ structure—is apparently
much prized. Of the mottled red and yellow glass, made
it would seem in imitation of tortoise-shell, there are
many examples in our collections. We are reminded by
it of some of the effects of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flambé</span></i> glazes; the prevailing
colour given to this glass is, however, of an
orange rather than a blood-red tint (<a href='#p49'>Pl. <span class='fss'>XLIX.</span></a> 2).</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c001' >But in spite of these early technical triumphs, blown
glass has always remained something of an exotic in
China. To the Chinese mind, glass—a material never
held in much esteem—is above all a substance to be
employed in the imitation of precious marbles and gems.
Lacking itself all classical and literary associations, glass
can only find a reflected honour from these more noble
substances. With this object in view, the skilled Chinese
craftsmen were soon able to produce the most marvellous
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tours de force</span></i>, and indeed to develop an entirely new
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_351' id='Page_351'>351</a></span>
treatment of the material—a method of handling which,
at all events since the best Roman times, had been elsewhere
completely neglected. Their aim above all was
the imitation of jade: half-molten masses of glass, of two
or more colours, were worked up and dragged through
one another; the glass was then carved into the old
traditional forms. Objects of the native stone were thus
imitated with the most marvellous accuracy. This was a
process much resembling that adopted by the Alexandrian
Greeks and the Romans for one class of their agate glass
bodies; but the Chinese showed greater restraint in the
blending of the colours, and were at greater pains to
imitate closely the natural stones. As I have said,
the forms taken by this glass follow those into which
the Chinese had been wont from time immemorial to
carve their jade, their agates, and their milky chalcedonies;
but we may note that their carvings in rock crystal were
not copied in glass. Besides the little tripod bowls and
cups with archaic designs in relief, natural objects were
imitated, fruits and flowers especially—the opening calix
of the lotus, the ‘Buddha’s hand’ citron, or again the
almond-shaped peach, symbol of long life.</p>

<p class='c001' >We must now turn to the little glass snuff-bottles, in
the decoration of which the Chinese carried their original
methods to the highest perfection. We have indeed in
these the only form of Chinese glass that has found any
favour with European collectors.</p>

<p class='c001' >The lid of these snuff-bottles is often of another
material—metal, coral, or carved lac—and to it is attached
the little ivory spoon with which the snuff is extracted.
I may point out that little flasks of similar shape, made
generally of porcelain, the <i>yao-ping</i> or medicine-bottles,
have long been in use in China for pills, rare drugs, and
eye-medicines. These <i>yao-ping</i>, whether for medicines
or for snuff, were often carved out of various stones—the
moss-agate and the red and white carnelian were
special favourites—and it was above all these many-coloured
varieties of the quartz family that were copied
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_352' id='Page_352'>352</a></span>
in glass, in the first place probably by the above-mentioned
Hu. The infinite variety in the technique
and in the decoration of these little flasks—this may
be seen in any large collection, such as that formed by
Mr. Salting<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c018'><sup>[278]</sup></a>—is at first overwhelming, but most of them
will fall under one or other of the following classes:—</p>

<p class='c001' >1. Snuff-bottles imitating a natural stone, as amianthus,
malachite, or chalcedony, formed by the simple
<em>interpenetration</em> of masses of glass of different colours.
Such bottles are generally not carved on the surface.</p>

<p class='c001' >2. Those of the nature of an onyx, built up by the
<em>superposition</em> of two or more layers of glass of different
colours, the under surface being exposed in places by the
carving away of the upper layers as in a cameo. We
thus get a carnelian red or a deep blue design on a milky
white ground. In other cases a jade-green passes by
gradation through a pink layer to a pure white. Such
an arrangement may be skilfully made use of to obtain a
blend of colours on the petals of a lotus or other flower.</p>

<p class='c001' >3. In this class the superficial colours do not enclose
the whole core, but lie scattered on the surface. By this
means green, red, blue, and yellow patches, all standing
on the same level, may be made use of in the design.
In such work we may see the climax of the Chinese
technique in this <i>genre</i>, and the result has apparently
been brought about by placing these patches of coloured
paste on the sides of the mould before the introduction of
the core of plain glass. Though this is technically a
triumph of ingenuity, the flasks thus decorated are by no
means the most beautiful of the series.</p>

<p class='c001' >Besides these, many other methods of decoration may
at times be found on these snuff-bottles; we see elaborate
designs painted in enamel on the interior, showing
through the transparent glass, or again an opaque paste
resembling porcelain may be decorated with colours on
the surface. Avanturine glass is probably of late introduction,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_353' id='Page_353'>353</a></span>
but spangles (of reduced copper) are sometimes
made to appear locally in the clear glass as a golden cloud.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c018'><sup>[279]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >We know little of the source or of the composition of
the glass used by the Chinese. Some of it was made in
Pekin, but the province of Shantung seems to have long
been the centre of the glass manufacture.<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c018'><sup>[280]</sup></a> Here were made
the little bricks of coloured glass (four inches by twelve
and two inches in thickness)—the <i>Po-li-chuan</i>—which
were sold to the glass-workers and enamellers in Pekin and
elsewhere. These glass bricks were at one time imitated
in Bohemia with the special object of supplying the
Chinese markets—the imitations were known in the trade
as <i>pomana</i>. As to the materials from which the native
glass was made, there is little or no available information.
We are told incidentally that it was compounded by
fusing a certain rock with saltpetre.<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c018'><sup>[281]</sup></a> This statement,
and the fact of the use of imported ‘metal’ from
Bohemia, make it probable that the glass belongs on the
whole to the potash family. So again, the Chinese have
long been acquainted with lead fluxes and enamels, and
it was doubtless this experience that enabled them to
command such a surprising range of colours in the
glasses with which they built up their little snuff-bottles.
We shall then probably not be wrong in regarding the
glass of these bottles as of the potash-lead family.<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c018'><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_354' id='Page_354'>354</a></span>
Finally, we may say of this Chinese glass that it can
lay claim to a prominent and distinct place in any general
history such as this, on the ground not only of the
originality of its technique, but also because of the
influence which, as I have already pointed out, it has had
of late years upon the ‘new glass’ of France.</p>

<p class='c019' >The position of <span class='sc'>Japan</span> with regard to glass is a
unique one. It is perhaps the only country that in past
or present times has taken an important place in the
world of art where the use of glass, whether for practical
or æsthetic purposes, has remained almost absolutely
unknown. I make this statement, of course, of the
country as it was before the late revolution. Nowadays
the art of glass-making, like other Western arts, is
practised with some success, but without, I think, any
original developments which would call for notice. The
name they have for glass—<i>bidoro</i>—is evidently derived
from the Spanish <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">vidrio</span></i>, or the Portuguese <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">vidro</span></i>. But
the Japanese never appear to have taken even that
sporadic interest in the material that they showed for
other exotic productions that at times filtered in from the
West.</p>

<p class='c001' >What I have said applies to feudal and recent times.
If, however, one goes back to the period that preceded
the dawn of Japanese history, one finds that plain beads
of clear glass, both blue and white, have been discovered
in the dolmen tombs.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c018'><sup>[283]</sup></a> Examples of these beads may be
seen in the Gowland collection in the British Museum.
Again, in the famous Shoso In Treasury at Nara are two
vessels of glass:—(1) a shallow bowl of transparent green
glass, carved in relief with a design of fishes and water-plants;
(2) a cup of white glass, carefully executed, the
surface carved with a diaper pattern made up of shallow
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_355' id='Page_355'>355</a></span>
hexagonal hollows. There is no reason to doubt the well-authenticated
record that these glass bowls were deposited
with the rest of the collection by the Emperor Shomu in
the year 756 of our era. There are in the same Shoso In,
and in other Imperial collections among objects dating
from this time, examples of metal ware and of silk brocade
that show evidence of a Western Asiatic, probably Sassanian,
origin. These and other objects that are undoubtedly
of an exotic origin may perhaps many of them
have been presents from the Chinese emperors on the
occasion of embassies from Japan. It is certainly a fact
that in the previous century the sons and retainers of the
last Sassanian ruler of Persia had fled before the Arab
invaders and taken refuge with the Chinese court, bringing
with them such treasure as they had been able to save
from the general wreck. This fact may give a hint as to
the origin of the Shoso In glass. At any rate, in China
at this period there is no evidence of any skill in glass-working.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'     >The history of glass in the nineteenth century is
mainly concerned with improvements in mechanical
processes, by means of which it is now
possible to turn out a perfectly clear white glass in large
quantities at greatly reduced cost.</p>

<p class='c001' >Meantime little heed has been given to the artistic
merit of individual pieces. In fact, thanks in no small
measure to one widely applied mechanical ‘improvement,’
the process namely of pressing into a mould, the highly
trained skill of the glass-blower has been less and less
called into play, so that now a complaint is heard, both in
England and in France, of the difficulty of finding workmen
thoroughly masters of the art. The last stage,
indeed, in the decline of our English cut-glass was
reached when ‘passable imitations’ of the facetted work
were turned out by this ‘pressing’ process.</p>

<p class='c001' >And yet from time to time attempts have been made
on the one hand to give fresh life to old methods of work
and schemes of decoration, on the other to develop the
application of the material along new or previously little
explored paths. Of what has been effected in Venice in
the first of these directions something has already been
said. In England, and we may add in Germany also (at
Berlin, for instance, and at Ehrenfeld, near Cologne),
these attempts have for the most part taken the direction
of revivals, as when by the skilful use of the blowing-iron
table-glass has been produced of graceful but rather
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_357' id='Page_357'>357</a></span>
fantastic outlines and with more or less reminiscence of
Venetian prototypes. I need not dwell upon such efforts,
as nothing in the way of a school has been founded. It
is indeed noticeable that both in Germany and in
England, in the case of the more expensive table-glass
that we now see in the shop windows, the decoration,
such as it is, has continued to be sought rather in processes
of cutting and engraving on the old lines.</p>

<p class='c001' >Various fantastic methods of surface decoration have
indeed found favour at times. An artificial iridescence
has been given to the surface by certain chemical agencies—perhaps
the most elaborate instance of such decoration
may be found in the ‘favrile’ glass of Messrs. Tiffany, the
well-known goldsmiths of New York. But as a rule,
the facility with which the desired result may be obtained
at little expense by means of modern chemical and
mechanical processes has led, in the case of glass, to that
want of reticence and restraint and to that habit of resting
content with the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à peu près</span></i>—the passable imitation—that
are characteristic of so much of the modern art productions
that fill the show-cases of exhibitions.</p>

<p class='c001' >Somewhat greater interest may be found in certain
applications of glass that have come to the front in
France of recent years. Here at all events there is a
public that takes some interest in the contemporary products
of the decorative arts. In the yearly <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salons</span></i>, beside
the pictures and the sculpture, these minor arts—jewellery,
metal-work, fayence and glass—find a prominent place
and a critical or enthusiastic public.</p>

<p class='c001' >It is, however, only within the last few years that
objects of glass have taken an important place among
these exhibits, and that this is so is above all due to
two men who, with considerable artistic talents, combine
great energy and both scientific and technical knowledge—these
are Émile Gallé and Henri Cros.</p>

<p class='c001' >Already many years ago the art of enamelling on
glass had been successfully revived in France—witness
the reproduction of a Saracenic mosque lamp made by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_358' id='Page_358'>358</a></span>
M. P. Brocard as far back as 1867.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c018'><sup>[284]</sup></a> But since that time
glass, as a material capable of artistic applications, has
been attacked upon new lines. When speaking of the
glass of the Chinese, I have more than once pointed to
the influence that the work of these people has apparently
had upon certain new developments in France. Something
of the sort—in the way, I mean, of treating glass as
if it were a stone of varied colours, carnelian or onyx—was
indeed attempted here in England as long ago as
1878, in the case of the cameo glass of Webb of Stourbridge.
Contemporary with him, Eugène Rousseau was
working in France with his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verres doublés et triplés</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c001' >But these strange new methods of treating glass are
above all associated with Émile Gallé, who at Nancy
(where he was born in 1846) has built up something like
a school. The material was attacked by him, as it were
from every side. Advantage was taken of the facility
with which, by means of powerful machinery, glass can
now be rapidly cut into any desired shape. As in the
case of the decoration of the modern porcelain of Sèvres
and other places, a source of more than one heat-resisting
colour has been found in chromium, and even such rare
elements as thallium and iridium have been experimented
with. By the skilful application of reducing and oxidising
flames, local variations of colour are brought about,
and (in this unconsciously following the Indian glass
that I spoke of in the last chapter) the possibilities of
artistic effect to be found in the presence of numberless
minute bubbles have not been neglected. The Chinese
have been surpassed in the strange pitted forms—in some
cases recalling cork or other kinds of bark—that the
surface of the glass has been made to assume. But
above all, in the varied markings, in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mouchetage</span></i> and
the arborescent forms, that loom out from the interior of
the glassy mass, M. Gallé has outdistanced all his predecessors.
Lately he has introduced pieces of metallic
foil, or again crystalline masses of amianthus or mica,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_359' id='Page_359'>359</a></span>
into the body of his glass; or again insects, realistically
rendered in enamel—dragon-flies are a great favourite—are
seen caught up within the mass.</p>

<p class='c001' >Both Gallé and others have made frequent use of an
incrustation process by which fragments of glass are
worked into the surface of a soft paste—but this was
a means of decoration known in Egypt in the days of
the Ptolemies. Endless gradations of colour are obtained
by laying or ‘soldering on’ successive thin layers of
glass until the desired effect is obtained. To some such
process are also due, it would seem, the delicate shades
seen in the Tiffany glass. Finally, by the use of rapidly
revolving boring-tools—some of them worked on a
vertical axis—the hardest Bohemian glass may be quickly
brought to the desired form.</p>

<p class='c001' >Apart from the yearly exhibitions, examples of the
glass of the Nancy school may be seen in Paris at the
Luxembourg and at the École des Arts et Métiers. It
cannot, however, be said that the general effect of this
glass is, as a rule, either brilliant or decorative.</p>

<p class='c001' >M. Gallé himself is something of a poet—of the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">symboliste</span></i> school, I should judge. What it is that he
aims at expressing by means of this often sombre glass
cannot indeed be better presented than in his own
words:—‘Mist and dews half shroud and half reveal the
fine veinings and splashings in a grey jade-crystal vase.
A thick flushing of rose-tinted glass is carved into a
chimera-like flower, half influorescent, half smiling, half
weary, half orchid, half pansy. A beetle drags its slow
length over the rust of the lichens. Side by side with
flesh-tints and carnations we see bold touches of coral
pink. A pale gleam steals through the dull maze of
iridium. Vegetable shadows grin at us. Phantoms of
bloom are dimly seen. A fossil shell engraved beneath
the fragile work contains the glass-worker’s signature.’—(Quoted
by H. Frantz, <cite>Magazine of Art</cite>, vol. xx. p. 269.)</p>

<p class='c001' >Of quite another nature is the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâte de verre</span></i>, a substance
somewhat of the nature of a glass frit, which has
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_360' id='Page_360'>360</a></span>
been made use of by the French sculptor, M. Henri Cros,
in the modelling of polychrome reliefs and friezes. I say
‘modelling,’ for this strange material can apparently be
worked like wax or plaster at one stage of its preparation.
When cold it is of so tough a nature that a nail may be
driven into it. At the entrance of the new hall of
Sculpture at the Luxembourg may be seen a relief of this
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâte de verre</span></i> forming the back of a fountain. As a
material it lies perhaps a little remote from the class of
objects with which we have been occupied in this book.
I mention it here as an example of the success which in
France of late years has attended the attempt to take
advantage of the new appliances and materials that,
thanks to recent scientific discoveries, lie at the command
of the artist and craftsman. Here, as in the case of the
potter’s art, not only have old-world processes—those of
the Far East above all—been revived, but a constant
endeavour is being made to strike out in new directions.</p>

<p class='c001' >Professor Buckman, in a paper in the <cite>Archæological Journal</cite> so long ago as
1851 gives some valuable analyses of ancient glass, the main result of which is to
show the absence of lead and the general use of copper as a source of blue, in
pre-Roman times at least. In many of these older analyses, as in those made by
Sir Humphry Davy, there always remains an element of doubt, not so much as
to the accuracy of the chemist’s work, but as to the <i>provenance</i> of the specimen
that he is examining. Professor Buckman dwells upon the light that properly
conducted analyses would throw upon the origin and classification of the glass of
the ancients. He does not, unfortunately, distinguish the nature of the alkali,
whether soda or potash, in his own analyses. Little work of this kind has been
accomplished in the fifty years that have since elapsed.</p>

by the late Mr. Thomas Arnold in an article by him in the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>.)
According to this tradition, Joseph of Arimathea, at the time of the
Crucifixion, proceeded first to the upper room where the Last Supper had been
celebrated and found there the shallow bowl that had held the Paschal Lamb.
Taking this vessel with him, and returning to the scene of the Crucifixion, he
received in it drops of blood from the side of our Lord. The double service of
the bowl is the essence of this tradition. Mr. Arnold, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</span></i> of the traditionary
connection of the Holy Graal with Glastonbury, quotes from Malmesbury a statement
that in his day an altar called ‘sapphirus,’ which had been brought from
Palestine to St. Davids, had been re-discovered. This may well have been a slab
of glass similar to that still preserved at Reichenau. I have been unable to find
any further reference to this ‘sapphirus’ altar.</p>

noble stocks of glass-makers in Lorraine. These were the families of Hennezel
(which claimed a Bohemian descent), of Thietry, of Du Thisac, and of Le Houx.
So in Normandy we find the names of De Bongar, De Caquery, Le Vaillant, and
De Brossard. Representatives of nearly all these families appear to have come to
England before the end of the sixteenth century, and their names, often strangely
corrupted, have been unearthed from parish registers and other documents in
many parts of England. The Lorrainers, at least, seem to have been all of them

much white opaque glass, in imitation of porcelain, was made near London. The
glass, he states, was rendered opaque by tin, by antimony, or by arsenic. Much
of this material was doubtless employed for enamelling on metal.</p>

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
